Hacking (1987) and White (2000) influentially\\nargue that it is not. We approach this question through a systematic\\nframework for self-locating epistemology. As it turns out, leading\\napproaches to self-locating evidence agree that the fact that our own\\nuniverse contains fine-tuned life indeed confirms the existence of a\\nmultiverse (at least in a suitably idealized setting). This convergence is\\nno accident: we present two theorems showing that in this setting, any\\nupdating rule that satisfies a few reasonable conditions will have the\\nsame feature. The conclusion that fine-tuned life provides evidence\\nfor a multiverse is hard to escape.\\n1\\nA Question of Size\\nReasoning about the size of physical reality is epistemologically fraught.\\nThis paper will explore what such reasoning involves.\\nModern discoveries in cosmology are often taken to give powerful evidence that physical reality is a lot bigger than we would otherwise have\\nsupposed. Physics seems to be staggeringly inhospitable for life. Given a\\nuniverse with our kind of laws, it would be extremely surprising for it to\\n∗ Thanks to Cian Dorr, Robert Hirsch, Benjamin Levinstein, participants in an epistemology seminar at the University of Southern California, and three anonymous referees for\\nvery helpful feedback.

Ian Hacking (1987) and Roger White (2000) have each argued that the\\nreasoning above relies on a fallacy. Hacking offers this analogy:\\nThe kibitzer asks, ‘Is this the first roll of the dice, do you think,\\nor have we made many a one earlier tonight?’ The gambler\\n. . . says, ‘Can I wait until I see how this roll comes out, before I\\nlay my bet with you on the number of past plays made tonight?’\\nThe kibitzer, no fool, agrees, although charging a slight fee for\\nallowing this extra ‘information’. The roll is double-six. The\\ngambler foolishly says, ‘Ha, that makes a difference—I think\\nthere have been quite a few rolls.’\\n[This gambler reasons] fallaciously. . . .\\nThe point is that the information available to the gambler is\\nthat double-six occurred at this throw. It is no more probable\\nthat double-six should occur at this throw, on the supposition\\nof many previous throws, than it is that it should occur at this\\nthrow, on the supposition that this is the first throw tonight\\n. . . (Hacking 1987, pp. 333–4).\\nHacking contends that just as the occurrence of an improbable double-six\\non this throw does not make it make it more probable that there are many\\nthrows overall, the occurrence of improbably life-permitting conditions in\\nthis universe does not make it more probable that there is a multiverse.\\nWhite (2000) develops and defends this line of argument (as we discuss in\\nsections 2 and 6).\\n1See Weinberg (1989) for a technical analysis of issues relating to the cosmological constant. For a more generally accessible overview, see Lewis and Barnes (2017).\\n2For an overview of multiverse physics see Vilenkin 2011; Guth 2007.\\n3We are interpreting fine-tuning as telling us something explicitly probabilistic: see\\nsections 5 and 7. There is some controversy about how one should read off probabilistic\\nclaims from facts about the values of the physical constants in parameter space (see inter alia\\nMcGrew, McGrew, and Vestrup 2001). But physicists are comfortable making such claims,\\nand while this is not the place to evaluate the basis of those claims, for the purposes of this\\nessay we are comfortable following them. See (Weinberg 1989, 2000) for discussion of the\\nphysics and (Hawthorne and Isaacs 2018) for philosophical discussion.\\n2\\n\\fObjectors to Hacking and White offer competing analogies,4 while their\\ndefenders marshal yet more analogies in reply.5 But, as this flurry of conflicting analogies shows, we don’t yet have a sufficient understanding of this\\nissue to see which analogies are apt and which are not. More systematic\\ntheorizing is needed.\\nFortunately, the last twenty years of epistemology are rich in resources\\nthat we can apply. The key issue is self-locating evidence, evidence concerning our own place in the world. If all we knew was the general fact\\nthat there is fine-tuned life, confirmation of a multiverse would be straightforward. Indeed, as we shall explain in section 3, nearly any mundane\\ngeneral facts support the multiverse hypothesis—and very specific general\\nqualitative evidence, of the sort that we routinely learn through ordinary\\nexperiences, supports the multiverse hypothesis very powerfully. But Hacking and White call our attention to other evidence we have besides general\\nqualitative facts: evidence not just about the existence of a certain sort of\\nuniverse, but about our own universe, and about ourselves.\\nThere is no consensus about how updating on such self-locating evidence should work; but there are some theories we can apply. In section 4\\nwe introduce three leading approaches, and in section 5 we show that all of\\nthem agree on the central question: the fact that our own universe contains\\nfine-tuned life does indeed confirm the existence of a multiverse. (However,\\nonly two of the three theories say that fine-tuning makes any difference to\\nthe strength of this evidence, beyond the simple fact that we are alive at\\nall: see section 6.) It is no accident that the leading theories agree on the\\ncentral question. In section 7 we present two theorems that show that any\\nrule for generating posterior probabilities that satisfies certain reasonable\\nconstraints (and some simplifications and idealizations) will lead to the\\nsame conclusion. The conclusion that fine-tuned life provides evidence for\\na multiverse is hard to escape.\\nThis essay is quite long, and different readers will be most interested in\\ndifferent parts. Readers who are interested in our dialectic with Hacking\\nand White will want to read sections 2 and 6, where we give our replies\\nto their arguments. Section 4 is aimed at catching readers up who are rel4For some examples: other dice rolls (McGrath 1988), a photographer who visits casinos\\n(Whitaker 1988), firing squads (Leslie 1988, 1989), school prizes (Holder 2002), and more\\ndice (Bradley 2009).\\n5To yet more dice (Rota 2005), a kidnapper with a mysterious card-sorting device (Juhl\\n2006), the decay of named uranium atoms (Draper, Draper, and Pust 2007), where in Brooklyn one’s parents lived (Leeds 2007), trying on off-the-rack suits (Landsman 2016) (this is a\\nturned-around version of one from (Rees 2008)), and more.\\n3\\n\\fatively unfamiliar with views on self-locating evidence. Section 5 applies\\nthese theories to fine-tuning and the multiverse; for those who are already\\ncomfortable with the theories in question (Compartmentalized Conditionalization, Self Indication, and Self Sampling) the summary in table 1 at the\\nend of section 5 may suffice. Some readers may wish to go directly to our\\nmost general results (which subsume those in section 5), and then read back\\nas needed: the main theorems can be found in section 7 and appendices A\\nand B.\\n2\\nThis Universe\\nHacking and White each argue that our evidence concerning fine-tuned life\\ndoes not support a multiverse. Let’s start by saying what is right about their\\ncriticism.\\nAs all parties concede, the general qualitative proposition there is finetuned life is straightforwardly evidence for the multiverse. (We discuss this\\nin more detail in section 3.) But this cannot settle the issue by itself. Our\\nrelevant evidence is not just the general evidence that there is fine-tuned\\nlife in some universe or other: rather, we know the more specific fact that\\nthere is fine-tuned life in this universe, our universe. As White points out,\\nit is illegitimate to ignore the specific evidence and only pay attention to\\nthe weaker general evidence. Specific evidence can screen off the import of\\ngeneral evidence.\\n. . . [O]f course the more universes there are, the more likely\\nit is that some universe supports life. That is, M [there is a\\nmultiverse] raises the probability of E0 [there is fine-tuned life]\\n. . . . But now, the response goes, we know that E0 is true since it\\nfollows from E [α contains fine-tuned life, where α is our own\\nuniverse]. So E0 confirms M even if E does not. In other words,\\nour knowledge that some universe is life-permitting seems to\\ngive us reason to accept the Multiple Universe hypothesis, even\\nif our knowledge that α is life-permitting does not.\\nWe can quickly see that there is something going wrong here.\\n. . . Suppose I’m wondering why I feel sick today, and someone\\nsuggests that perhaps Adam got drunk last night. . . . Perhaps if\\nall I knew (by word of mouth, say) was that someone or other was\\nsick, this would provide some evidence that Adam got drunk.\\nBut not when I know specifically that I feel sick. This suggests\\n4\\n\\fthat in the confirming of hypotheses, we cannot, as a general\\nrule, set aside a specific piece of evidence in favor of a weaker\\npiece. (White 2000, p. 264)\\nAll of this is correct.\\nBut Hacking and White each go further, and make a positive claim about\\nthe import of our specific evidence (“this universe contains fine-tuned life”):\\nnamely, that it is independent of how many universes there are, and does\\nnot confirm the hypothesis that there are many universes rather than one.\\nThis conclusion, we contend, is premature. We just don’t understand how\\nsingular evidence like this works nearly well enough be confident in such\\njudgments. What’s more, we will argue (in sections 5 to 7) that there are\\nstrong systematic reasons to think that this further claim is false. We will\\nmake the case that that our specific evidence does confirm a multiverse.\\nThere are many difficult issues about the probabilities of singular propositions. White’s main argument illustrates some of these difficulties (2000,\\n262–263). White writes, “Let α be our universe and let T1 be the configuration which is necessary to permit life to evolve.” He then considers the\\nclaim “α instantiates T1 ”:\\n. . . [T]he probability of this is just 1/n, regardless of how many\\nother universes there are, since α’s initial conditions and constants are selected randomly from a set of n equally probable\\nalternatives, a selection which is independent of the existence of\\nother universes.\\nBut this conclusion does not follow, for subtle reasons. One of the dangers\\nof de re probability ascriptions is that they are susceptible to Frege puzzles\\n(see for example Chalmers 2011). We can grant what White insists on:\\nThe name ‘α’ is to be understood here as rigidly designating the\\nuniverse which happens to be ours. Of course, in one sense,\\na universe can’t be ours unless it is life-permitting. But the\\nuniverse which happens actually to be ours, namely α, might not\\nhave been ours, or anyone’s. It had a slim chance of containing\\nlife at all. (White 2000, p. 274, note 6, original emphasis)\\nBut this still does not settle the issue.\\nConsider a simple toy model. There is either one universe stamped with\\nthe label Universe One, or two universes stamped with the labels Universe\\nOne and Universe Two, respectively. (The labels are stamped on the outside,\\nso people inside a universe can’t see them.) If there is one universe, then\\n5\\n\\fthe objective chance that Universe One has life is 1/n. If there are two\\nuniverses, then the chance that Universe One has life is 1/n, and the chance\\nthat Universe Two has life is 1/n, and these are independent. All of these\\nfacts are known. Roger is in Universe One, but for all he can tell he might\\nbe in Universe Two. Roger says “Let α be my universe.” So “α” rigidly\\ndesignates Universe One—though Roger does not know this.\\nThe objective chance that α would contain life is 1/n. But it does not follow\\nin this case that the prior epistemic probability of “α contains life” is 1/n. We\\nmust be extremely careful when we try to apply chance-credence principles\\nto de re probabilities: chance statements are referentially transparent; epistemic probability statements are not (see Hawthorne 2002; Hawthorne and\\nLasonen-Aarnio 2009).6 For example, one might introduce a name like this:\\n“Let β be Universe One if Universe One contains life or there is just one universe, and otherwise Universe Two.” In this case, β in fact is Universe One,\\nand has chance 1/n of containing life. But the prior epistemic probability\\nof “β contains life” is the same as the objective chance that either Universe\\nOne or Universe Two contains life—which is clearly higher than 1/n.\\nThe prior probability of “Universe One contains life” is 1/n. But the\\nprior probability of “α is Universe One” is less than one (even though this\\nis a metaphysically necessary truth): Roger can tell that he is in α, but he\\ncan’t tell that he is in Universe One. So it does not follow from the fact that\\n“Universe One has life” has prior probability 1/n that “α has life” has prior\\nprobability 1/n. The correct prior probability is difficult to determine. In\\nparticular, it is obscure whether this is independent of how many universes\\nthere are. (There are two reasons “α” is much less clear-cut than “β”. First,\\nthe way the name “α” was introduced leaves it unclear what it refers to, if\\nanything, in cases where Roger is not in any universe—for example, cases\\nin which no universe contains any life at all. Second, it is unclear what prior\\nprobability Roger should assign to being in one universe or another. We\\ndiscuss the second issue in section 6 and appendix B.)\\nIn a later postscript, White (2003, p. 244) writes about his use of the\\nproper name α,\\nI admit that there are difficult issues here in which I would\\nrather not get entangled, and I regret putting the argument in\\nthese terms as I now think the crucial issue is independent of\\n6In our discussion of de re probabilities in this section we will speak as if sentences are\\nthe bearers of probability—since if α is Universe One, the proposition that α contains life may\\nwell be the same as the proposition that Universe One contains life. In section 4 we will\\nintroduce a different way of avoiding this difficulty for our more official framework.\\n6\\n\\fthese matters . . .\\nHe then dispenses with the proper name and proceeds in first-personal\\nterms.7 This is a good idea. Instead of the evidence one might state with\\n“α has fine-tuned life” (where “α” has been introduced as a proper name\\nfor this universe) or “This universe has fine-tuned life,” we will focus on\\nevidence one might state with “I am in a universe that contains fine-tuned\\nlife.” (Each of us has evidence we can express with these words; we do\\nnot presuppose that it is the same evidence in each case. We handle this\\nmore carefully in section 4.) It would be surprising if evidence stated in\\nterms of “this universe” and evidence stated in terms of “my universe” had\\ndramatically different import. The standard label for evidence about oneself\\nis self-locating evidence.8\\nThis narrows the scope of the problem, but it does not make it easy. The\\ndifficulties of probabilistic self-locating epistemology are well-known (for\\noverview, see Meacham 2008; Titelbaum 2016; Manley, Manuscript). There\\nis nothing like a consensus about how this works. But we are not utterly at\\na loss: we have some proposals we can apply, and a framework in which\\nwe can make the questions precise.\\nIt is worth clarifying what White means, and what we mean, by the question of whether something confirms the multiverse. The standard Bayesian\\npicture is that evidential support means probability-raising—but with respect to what? The picture that has been assumed is that there are certain\\nprior epistemic probabilities, and that to confirm a hypothesis (in the sense at\\nissue) is to raise its probability above its prior probability. Note that these\\n“priors” cannot be literally understood as the credences that you had at\\nsome earlier time: for the priors are unopinionated about whether there is\\nlife, or concrete agents, or any complex matter. It is difficult to make sense of\\nan agent (even a highly idealized agent) who is so deprived of evidence as to\\nbe unopinionated about such questions as these. Instead, we are thinking\\nabout the priors as epistemic ur-priors.9 Such probabilities encode rela7“If my observation is to provide me with evidence of these other rolls, they will have to\\nmake it more likely that I would observe this” White (2003, p. 245, original emphasis). We\\ntake up his ensuing argument in section 6.\\n8Some philosophers pursue the ambitious project of reducing all attitudes toward singular propositions to self-locating attitudes (see Lewis 1979; Chalmers 2011; Ninan 2013; for\\ncritical discussion see Cappelen and Dever 2013; Magidor 2015; Yli-Vakkuri and Hawthorne\\n2018). We need not take any stand here on this ambitious project’s prospects. Stalnaker\\n(2008) and Moss (2012) use the same kind of trick in the other direction, reducing questions\\nof self-locating probabilities to questions about probabilities of propositions stated using\\nspecial names or demonstratives.\\n9This idea arises from (Keynes 1921) and (Carnap 1950) and is defended by (Williamson\\n7\\n\\ftions of evidential support between qualitative propositions; it is natural\\nto model these using objective physical chances, imagining, as White said,\\nthat the universe’s “initial conditions and constants are selected randomly.”\\nIn order to sidestep the complications we just discussed concerning de re\\nprobabilities, for most of this paper we will only suppose there to be ur-prior\\nprobabilities for general qualitative propositions—such as the proposition\\nthat there are many universes, or that there is life. We do not assume that\\nour posterior probabilities can be calculated simply by conditionalizing the\\nur-priors: rather, we will be considering a variety of updating rules for selflocating evidence, which somehow or other take you from qualitative priors\\nand self-locating evidence to generate self-locating posterior probabilities.10\\nIt may be a vague matter what the exact ur-priors are; it may also be a\\n“subjective” matter in some sense. We will not take up these foundational\\nissues further here.\\n3\\nQualitative Evidence and Multiverses\\nBefore we consider theories of self-locating evidence, let’s take a step back\\nand consider the import of our qualitative evidence a bit more carefully.\\nFor the moment, we set self-location aside.\\nYou know that you’re reading a philosophical argument right now.\\nThat’s a non-qualitative proposition. So for the time being we’ll pretend\\nthat you only know something weaker and qualitative—that someone reads\\na philosophical argument at some point. Given this pretense, everything\\nis technically tractable: qualitative hypotheses can straightforwardly be assigned prior probabilities, and updating on qualitative evidence can be done\\nby straightforward conditionalization. But doing so yields alien results.\\nLet’s make some simplifying assumptions. Suppose we know that either\\n(1) there is a single universe, or (2) there is a multiverse containing 10100\\nuniverses. Suppose that our expectations about the intrinsic properties of\\nany given universe are the same whether it’s a solitary universe or part of\\na multiverse, and also that what goes on in one universe in a multiverse is\\nprobabilistically independent of what goes on in each other universe in that\\nmultiverse.11 Suppose furthermore that each universe is finite, extending\\n2000); for overview see (Meacham 2016).\\n10In appendix B we also consider the more ambitious idea of self-locating ur-priors, and\\nthe relationship between these rules and conditionalization. (Arntzenius and Dorr 2017);\\nsee again (Meacham 2016).\\n11Compare our discussion of separable priors in section 7 and appendix A.\\n8\\n\\fno more than a quadrillion (1015 ) light years across and lasting for no more\\nthan a quadrillion years. Suppose that the prior probability of a multiverse\\nis just one in a million.\\nWhat happens to that probability given our qualitative evidence? You\\nmight expect that the only relevant evidence will involve technical details\\nfrom physics. But in fact mundane evidence looms even larger.\\nTo take a famous example, Borges (1941) imagined a library containing all possible 410-page books of a particular format and alphabet. Such\\na library must be truly gargantuan, containing well over 104000 books—\\nstaggeringly too many to fit in a single universe with the specified dimensions.12 Suppose you read one of Borges’s books13—one of the very many\\n“random-looking” books, not a long string of the letter q, or the text of\\nParadise Lost. The qualitative evidence you gain is just that someone reads\\na 410-page book of such-and-such qualitative profile at some point. Given\\na solitary universe, this evidence is ludicrously unlikely: only a minuscule\\nproportion of all Borges-books can be found in a single universe. Given\\na multiverse, this evidence is still ludicrously unlikely. There are so many\\nBorges-books—many orders of magnitude more than 10100 —that only very\\nfew of them can be found even in a large multiverse. But the tiny probability of finding this Borges book somewhere in 10100 universes is nearly 10100\\ntimes greater than the even tinier probability given just one shot. So, given\\nour assumptions, the fact that someone reads a book with some particular\\nrandom-looking qualitative profile is staggeringly strong evidence for the\\nmultiverse. This evidence alone raises the probability of a multiverse from\\none in a million to about 99.9 · · · 999%, where that’s a string of 94 nines.\\nIn fact, the qualitative evidence gained by reading nearly any book\\nwill overwhelmingly support the multiverse. A 410-page history of the\\nNapoleonic wars will have a similar effect. Such a book is substantially more\\nlikely to be found in a single universe than 410 pages of specific gibberish,\\nbut still extremely unlikely: given reasonable assumptions, the probability\\nthat a universe would contain any book containing those particular words\\nin that order is still much less than one in 10100 .14 So it is still nearly 10100\\n12If we assume that each book is at least the size of a postage stamp and lasts at least a\\nnanosecond, and that no two books have overlapping spatiotemporal envelopes, then there\\nare well under 10150 distinct books per universe.\\n13There’s a charming website that generates them: https://libraryofbabel.info/\\n14Even if each page of the book only contains a hundred words, and each word only\\nprovides an average of one bit of new information, there are still more than 10500 410-page\\nhistories of the Napoleonic wars in Borges’ library. Again only a tiny proportion of these\\nbooks fit in a single universe.\\n9\\n\\ftimes more likely that someone would read that sequence of words in a\\nmultiverse of 10100 universes than in a single a universe. Similarly, listening\\nto music, eating sandwiches, or paying attention to just about anything else\\nin ordinary life is liable to provide qualitative information that is so specific\\nthat it is massively unlikely for things just like that to arise in a single universe. The only goings-on that will not massively confirm a multiverse are\\nthose which have a reasonable shot at going on in any single universe. And\\neven such extremely banal goings-on still count in favor of the multiverse\\nat least a little, unless they are certain to occur, come what may.\\nThe root issue here is that our qualitative evidence is ordinarily about\\nwhat there is rather than what there isn’t. You can learn just by looking\\nthat there are brown horses. You can’t ordinarily learn just by looking that\\nthere are no blue horses. Of course, you can learn that there are no blue\\nhorses near you, but that’s not a general qualitative proposition.15 If the\\nuniverse is big and random enough, then it’s nearly sure to contain blue\\nhorses. If you did somehow learn that there are—without restriction—no\\nblue horses, that would be overwhelming evidence against the existence of\\na large and random multiverse. But it’s hard to see how one would learn\\nthat sort of thing.\\nWe can make this point more precise. For worlds w and w + , let a\\nqualitative embedding of w in w + be a one-to-one function from the concrete\\nobjects in w to concrete objects in w + which preserves all intrinsic properties\\nand relations; in this case, say that w + embeds w. Intuitively, w + includes\\na qualitative copy of everything in w, and perhaps more besides. Call a\\nproposition p local iff for any world w in which p is true, p is also true in\\nany world w + that embeds w.16 Similarly, let a local property be one that is\\npreserved by embeddings of one world in another.\\nAny local proposition that is true in a single universe is also true in any\\nmultiverse that includes a copy of that single universe. Whatever probability such a proposition may have conditional on there being a single\\nuniverse (strictly between zero and one), the probability must be greater\\nconditional on there being many universes. (This still supposes that the intrinsic qualitative profiles of each universe are independent and identically\\n15One complication is that natural kind terms like “horse” are plausibly not really qualitative either. Let this discussion be officially understood as concerning qualitative horseduplicates.\\n16For propositions expressed in a first-order language where all predicates stand for\\nintrinsic properties or relations, local propositions are precisely those expressed by ∃1\\nsentences: those that consist of a string of existential quantifiers in front of a quantifier-free\\nformula. (See Russell 2020).\\n10\\n\\fdistributed.) It follows that local qualitative evidence can’t help but support\\na multiverse—and the more specific the evidence is (that is, the smaller its\\nprior probability), the more powerfully it supports a multiverse.\\nHow can it be that our qualitative evidence can count strongly in favor\\nof a multiverse, but can’t count against it? This is due to an asymmetry in\\nwhat this qualitative evidence can be like. Any non-trivial local qualitative\\nproposition q counts in favor of a multiverse. In that case, not-q would\\ncount as evidence against a multiverse. But we have supposed that while q\\nis the sort of proposition one can have as evidence, not-q is not: the negation\\nof a local proposition is generally not a local proposition itself. There are blue\\nhorses is local, but its negation there are no blue horses is not.\\nThis kind of powerful confirmation of extravagant hypotheses by mundane evidence is unsettling. Fine-tuning evidence works this way, too.\\n(That is, the qualitative aspect of fine-tuning goes the same way. It remains\\nto be seen whether fine-tuning makes a special difference to self-locating evidence.) It tells us that the existence of life and complexity is very unlikely\\ngiven a single universe—much, much less likely than one might have naïvely\\nexpected. This gives us reason to think that some very general local facts\\nabout our universe—such as the existence of life, stars, or tungsten—have\\nextremely low prior probability given a single universe. If the probability\\nof life given a single universe is p (and each universe’s chance at life is\\nindependent of the others), then the existence of life improves the odds of\\nthe multiverse hypothesis by a factor of (1 − (1 − p)n )/p. For large n this\\napproaches 1/p. If p is very small, this is very powerful confirmation.\\nBut even without fine-tuning, we already had some evidence with this\\nsame feature: local qualitative facts that have very low prior probability,\\ngiven a single universe, simply due to including a lot of detail.\\nCan massive confirmation of a multiverse be escaped? In this section\\nwe’ve been ignoring self-locating evidence. This suggests that it may be\\nsurprisingly important that we take self-locating evidence into account!\\nYou don’t just know that someone read such-and-such book, listened to suchand-such music, ate such-and-such a sandwich, and so on. You know that\\nyou read such-and-such book, listened to such-and-such music, ate suchand-such a sandwich, and so on. This self-locating evidence might help.\\nIt might—as Hacking and White claim—screen off the qualitative evidence\\nfrom multiverse hypotheses. It’s not obvious whether it does. But selflocating evidence is our most plausible hope for avoiding the overwhelming\\nconfirmation of extravagant hypotheses.\\n11\\n\\f4\\nThree Rules for Self-Locating Evidence\\nLet us be very clear: there is no settled method for the epistemology of\\nself-locating evidence. All of the precise theories we know of face very\\nserious objections. There is no final science we can present here, but we will\\nbegin by introducing three leading approaches to the problem. In section 7\\nwe present general results that encompass many alternative self-locating\\nepistemologies besides these three.\\nOf course, one can easily find many more than three theories of selflocating belief in the philosophy literature. (For helpful overview see Titelbaum 2013, 2016; for a few more recent approaches see also Meacham 2016;\\nArntzenius and Dorr 2017; Schwarz 2017; Builes 2020). But many of the differences between these theories are in their answers to questions that don’t\\nimmediately arise here: questions about the passage of time, forgetting\\ninformation, or people or universes that undergo fission and branching.\\nNone of these tricky issues are immediately relevant here: while they can\\narise for agents thinking about fine-tuning, they don’t have to. For the sake\\nof clarity, we will begin by focusing on simple cases where they do not\\narise. In the end, some of the additional complications may turn out to\\nbe relevant. Branching universes—which feature in some interpretations\\nof quantum mechanics—seem especially relevant for a complete account of\\nmultiverse epistemology (see inter alia Greaves 2004; Bradley 2011; Wilson\\n2013; Sebens and Carroll 2016). The general results we present in section 7\\nare less sensitive to the simplifications we will make here.\\nWe are only considering propositions that can be expressed using sentences with just the words “I”, “now”, and qualitative vocabulary. We can\\nthink of any such sentence as having the canonical form “I am now F”\\nwhere F expresses a qualitative property.17 It is helpful to model things by\\nfocusing on the properties, rather than the propositions. If you have the\\nevidence you would express with the sentence “I am now happy,” we can\\nsay your self-locating evidence includes the property being happy. While\\nwe do not wish to presuppose that we each express the same proposition\\nwith this sentence whenever we say it, many people can self-ascribe this\\nproperty on many occasions. We can handle ordinary qualitative evidence\\nas a special case: we can associate each qualitative proposition p with the\\n“boring” qualitative property being such that p.18\\n17Again, we do not wish to presuppose that all propositions can be reduced to propositions\\nexpressed this way.\\n18In general, we should not presuppose that being such that p requires being someone; we\\ndiscuss this in appendix B, which is the only place it makes a difference.\\n12\\n\\fAs it is convenient to represent propositions with sets of worlds, it is\\nconvenient to represent properties of agents with sets of centers, which are\\ntriples ha, t, wi of an agent, a time, and an epistemically possible world.\\n(We will think of worlds as specified in qualitative and eternal terms.) For\\nexample, being happy is represented by the set of triples ha, t, wi of an\\nagent a who is happy at time t in world w. So one’s total self-locating\\n(and qualitative) evidence can be represented as a set of centers: if one’s\\ntotal self-locating evidence is that one is F, then these are the centers that\\nrepresent agents who are F.19 We will call these live centers, and centers\\nthat are not in this set dead.\\nTo keep things tractable, we will suppose there are only finitely many\\ndistinct worlds, each of which contains finitely many centers.20 We start\\nwith a prior probability distribution over these worlds; these priors assign\\nprobabilities to qualitative matters, but are silent on self-locating matters.\\n(As we discussed in section 2, we are thinking of these as cosmological “urpriors” rather than actual credences someone had at an earlier time.) We\\nwill consider various rules that take a qualitative prior, together with selflocating evidence (represented by a set of live centers), and produce posterior\\nprobabilities for each world. The posterior probability of any qualitative\\nproposition can then be calculated by adding up the probabilities of the\\nworlds in it. The rules work by assigning posterior probabilities to each\\ncenter, and thereby to possessing any particular qualitative property (by\\nadding up the centers in that property). But our main focus will be on the\\nprobabilities of qualitative hypotheses—like the hypothesis that there are\\nmany universes.\\nConsider a really simple situation. There are three worlds. World 1\\nhas someone in a black room (and no one else). World 2 has someone in a\\nwhite room (and no one else). And world 3 has two people in a black room\\nand one person in a white room (and no one else). Let’s suppose that each\\nworld has prior probability 1/3. You find yourself in a black room: being in\\na black room is your total self-locating evidence. What posterior probabilities\\nshould you assign to each world?\\nHere’s the first method for assigning probabilities.21\\n19This builds in the implicit assumption that one’s evidence includes being an agent.\\n20This assumption is relaxed somewhat in appendices A and B. Worlds containing infinitely many agents are of serious interest in modern cosmology. An important open question is the so-called “measure problem,” which in effect amounts to the problem of finding\\nan appropriate self-locating epistemology for infinite worlds (for overview see Vilenkin\\n2011; Guth 2007, sec. 4).\\n21Halpern 2004; Meacham 2008; see also Builes 2020.\\n13\\n\\fUpdating\\nInitial Probability\\nWorld 1\\n1/3\\nWorld 2\\n1/3\\nWorld 3\\n1/3\\nFinal Probability\\n1/2\\n1/3\\n0\\n0\\n1/6\\n1/6\\n0\\n1/2\\nFigure 1: Compartmentalized Conditionalization.\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization.\\n1. For each world w that contains any live centers, divide the probability of w evenly between them: that is, assign each live center\\nprobability p/n, where p is the prior probability of w and n is\\nthe number of live centers in w.\\n2. Assign each dead center probability zero.\\n3. Renormalize so everything adds up to one.\\nWhen it comes to qualitative propositions, Compartmentalized Conditionalization for the evidence being F amounts to standard conditionalization\\non the qualitative proposition someone is F.\\nLet’s work through the simple case (fig. 1). The world containing no one\\nin a black room is ruled out, and the probabilities of the remaining worlds\\nare renormalized. So the agent winds up having credence 1/2 in world 1\\nand credence 1/2 in world 3.\\nThe main motivating feature of Compartmentalized Conditionalization\\nis the idea that the probability of qualitative hypotheses is unaffected by\\npurely self-locating information: the support that being F gives to a qualitative hypothesis is precisely the same as that of the qualitative proposition\\nsomeone is F. This same feature, though, makes Compartmentalized Conditionalization hopeless for avoiding confirmation of multiverses. As we\\ndiscussed, non-trivial propositions of the form someone is F (where F is\\n14\\n\\fany local property) will always confirm large random multiverses over single universes. According to Compartmentalized Conditionalization, selflocating evidence does nothing for qualitative hypotheses beyond what\\nthese qualitative propositions do.\\nThere are serious objections to Compartmentalized Conditionalization\\nbesides this. There are other reasons to think that self-locating information should make a difference to the probability of qualitative hypotheses.\\nConsider a simple example adapted from Ruth Weintraub (Weintraub 2004;\\nsee also Bostrom 2002; Titelbaum 2008; Briggs 2010; Dorr, Manuscript).22\\nThere will certainly be three people. A fair coin is flipped. If the coin is\\nheads, one person sees a red light, and two see a green light. If the coin\\nlands tails, two people see a red light, and one sees a green light. It seems\\nclear that seeing a red light is evidence that the coin came up tails. (Indeed,\\nit seems clear how strong this evidence is: one is twice as likely to see a\\nred light if the coin came up tails, so the posterior odds should be 2 : 1.)\\nBut the proposition at least one person sees a red light is evidence for neither\\nhypothesis.23 Compartmentalized Conditionalization has few defenders in\\neither physics or philosophy.\\nMichael Titelbaum’s (2008; 2012; see also 2016, p. 674) “Certainty Loss\\nFramework” (CLF) says that Compartmentalized Conditionalization is correct in certain restricted cases: in our terminology, these are cases where,\\nwhatever one’s evidence might be, there is at most one live center in each\\npossible world.24 This restriction avoids the apparent counterexamples of\\nthe kind we just considered. But this restricted rule falls silent on the mul22Weintraub’s original case involved a single person at three times, with memory loss\\nafter each flash of light.\\n23Sometimes Compartmentalized Conditionalization also recommends changing one’s\\nview in odd ways. Consider this example. Initially, with objective chance 1/2 there is one\\nperson in a black room, and with chance 1/2 there are two people in separate black rooms.\\nEach person flips a fair coin and observes how it lands. According to Compartmentalized\\nConditionalization, before the coin flip one should have credence 1/2 in being the only\\nperson, but after the coin flip (however it lands) one should assign credence 2/5 to being the\\nonly person.\\n24“CLF allows an agent to update by Compartmentalized Conditionalization only if for\\neach time and each centered proposition she entertains, the agent has some uncentered\\nproposition she is certain at that time has the same truth-value as the centered proposition”\\n(2016, p. 674). One complication for applying Titelbaum’s theory in our setting—or any\\ntheory that is engineered primarily as a diachronic constraint on agents—is that the “priors”\\nwe are considering over cosmological hypotheses are not literally the prior credences of\\nany agent. Here we are extending Titelbaum’s theory to apply to these ideal “ur-priors” so\\nthat we can derive lessons about fine-tuning; but Titelbaum himself may not welcome this\\nextension.\\n15\\n\\ftiverse cases we are interested in, which can involve multiple agents in the\\nsame world with the same self-locating evidence. Titelbaum’s strategy for\\nderiving verdicts for cases that do not satisfy the single-center constraint\\nis to find analogous cases that do satisfy it. We think that this strategy\\ncan be applied to multiverse models we consider in section 5; when carried\\nthrough, the upshot is that Titelbaum’s CLF approach delivers the very\\nsame verdicts in these cases as the next rule we will consider: Self-Indication\\n(see footnote 29). (In cases where the single-center restriction does hold,\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization and Self-Indication give precisely\\nthe same results.) So we will not consider CLF as a separate rule in what\\nfollows.\\nHere’s the second method for assigning probabilities.25\\nSelf Indication.\\n1. Assign each center the probability of the world it is in.\\n2. Reassign each dead center probability zero.\\n3. Renormalize so everything adds up to one.\\nWhen it comes to qualitative hypotheses, the effect of Self Indication is\\nthat the relative probability of each world w is boosted by the number\\nof live centers in w. That is, we can calculate the posterior probability\\nof w by multiplying Pr(w) by the number of live centers in w, and then\\nrenormalizing.\\nLet’s work through the simple example again (fig. 2). First, each of the\\ncenters representing an agent in a black room is assigned 1/3 (the probability\\nof its world). Second, the centers representing agents in white rooms are\\nzeroed out. Finally, we renormalize. So the agent winds up with credence\\n1/3 in world 1 and credence 2/3 in world 3. Since there is one live center\\nin world 1, zero live centers in world 2, and two live centers in world 2, we\\neliminate world 2 and boost the relative probability of world 3 by a factor\\nof two (from 1 : 1 odds to 2 : 1 odds).\\nUnfortunately, Self Indication does not escape the result that mundane\\nevidence overwhelmingly confirms multiverse hypotheses, either. Self Indication confirms a hypothesis in proportion to its expected number of\\nlive centers—the more live centers, the more confirmation. For any local\\n25Bostrom (2002, p. 66) uses the name the “Self-Indication Assumption” for this principle:\\n“Given the fact that you exist, you should (other things equal) favor hypotheses according\\nto which many observers exist over hypotheses on which few observers exist.” For versions\\nof this idea promoted by physicists, see Vilenkin (1995, eq. (1) on p. 847) and Olum (2002).\\n16\\n\\fUpdating\\nInitial Probability\\nWorld 1\\n1/3\\nWorld 2\\n1/3\\nWorld 3\\n1/3\\n1/3\\n1/3 0\\n1/3\\n1/3 1/3 0\\nFinal Probability\\n1/3\\n0\\n2/3\\nFigure 2: Self Indication\\nproperty F, if the expected number of such centers in a single universe is\\nn, then the expected number of such centers in a multiverse of a trillion\\nindependent universes is a trillion times n—so this kind of multiverse is\\nconfirmed by a factor of a trillion over a single universe. This does not solve\\nthe problem of mundane evidence confirming extravagant hypotheses.\\nWe’d like to note that, while it is counterintuitive, there is a certain sense\\nto this kind of confirmation of extravagant hypotheses. Putting things very\\ncasually, one might think that the more people there are, the more likely it\\nwould be that you are one of them. It is thus fairly natural to think that your\\nexistence is evidence for there being more people. We’re not saying that\\nwe’re happy with this verdict. But we are saying that unhappiness with it\\nshouldn’t be considered decisive.\\nHere’s the third method for assigning probabilities.26\\nSelf Sampling.\\n1. For each world w that contains any centers at all, divide the\\n26Bostrom (2002, p. 57) uses the label “Self Sampling” for this principle: “All other things\\nequal, an observer should reason as if they are randomly selected from the set of all possible\\nobservers.” Note that this original use of the term does not pick out a specific rule; we use\\nthe term in a more specific sense, combining Bostrom’s idea with the idea that there is no\\nadditional re-weighting of qualitative worlds. For Self Sampling reasoning in physics, see\\nPage (1999, especially pp. 226–227) (However, this example is complicated by considerations\\nabout quantum measures, which we return to in section 7).\\n17\\n\\fUpdating\\nInitial Probability\\nWorld 1\\n1/3\\nWorld 2\\n1/3\\nWorld 3\\n1/3\\nFinal Probability\\n1/3\\n1/3 0\\n1/9\\n1/9 1/9 0\\n3/5\\n0\\n2/5\\nFigure 3: Self Sampling\\nprobability of w evenly between all of them: that is, assign each\\ncenter probability p/n, where p is the prior probability of w and\\nn is the total number of centers in w.\\n2. Reassign each dead center probability zero.\\n3. Renormalize so everything adds up to one.\\nThe effect is that the relative probability of each world w containing any\\ncenters is boosted according to the proportion of live centers among all\\ncenters in w.\\nLet’s work through the simple example one more time (section 4). First\\nwe assign each of the centers in world 1 and world 2 probability 1/3, and\\nwe split the probability of world 3 between its three centers, giving each\\n1/9. Then we reset the white-room centers to zero, and renormalize. So the\\nagent winds up having credence 3/5 in world 1 and credence 2/5 in world\\n3.\\nUnlike the other two rules, Self Sampling does not have the effect that\\nmundane local evidence confirms vast worlds. Self Sampling has a compensating mechanism, already on display in the simple example: if a world\\ncontains centers that don’t fit your evidence, then these take away from the\\nprobability of the centers that do match your evidence. Suppose that each\\nuniverse has the same probabilities of producing centers of any particular\\nkind, regardless of what other universes there may be, and suppose you\\n18\\n\\fhave the evidence I am F, where F expresses a specific enough local property so that it is unlikely that anyone is F in a single universe. If the issue\\nis merely that F is specific, then it can still be very likely that there are\\nagents in a single universe who are other ways besides F. (That is, we are\\nnot here considering a fine-tuning scenario in which it is unlikely that there\\nis anyone at all in a single universe.) In that case, the multiverse hypothesis\\nwill make it much more probable that someone is F—but one should also\\nexpect, given a multiverse, that there will be vastly more agents who are\\nnot F. The Self Sampling rule weighs each world containing agents according to the proportion of F agents among all agents in that world. There is\\nno general reason why the expected proportion among multiverse worlds\\ncontaining agents should be any different from the expected proportion for\\na single universe containing agents. So unlike the other rules we have considered, Self Sampling need not confirm multiverses given just mundane\\nlocal evidence.\\nBut Self Sampling has other problems. One objection is the famous\\n“Doomsday argument” (Carter 1983; Leslie 1990; see also Bostrom 2002,\\npp. 89ff. and references therein). Suppose that Earth is the only populated\\nplanet, and that there is a doomsday device that will destroy all life on earth\\nin the year 2200 with a known objective chance of one in a million. Suppose\\nthat if the human race is not destroyed, we are guaranteed to endure for a\\nbillion years, stretching out beyond our galaxy and colonizing the universe.\\nThe odds seem good. But Self Sampling tells us to be very confident that the\\ndoomsday device will go off. Suppose that whether or not the doomsday\\ndevice goes off, you can tell who you are and when it is: your evidence rules\\nout you being in any other person’s predicament, or now being any other\\ntime. So in each doomsday world, and likewise in each glorious-future\\nworld, there is just one center compatible with your self-locating evidence.\\nBut in a world with more centers total, the single live center receives a much\\nsmaller share of that world’s probability. Since there are more centers in\\nglorious-future worlds than doomsday worlds by a factor of billions, the\\nposterior probability of the doomsday hypothesis is boosted from one in a\\nmillion to close to one.\\nA second problem for Self-Sampling is that it is not entirely clear what\\nit says: its recommendations are sensitive to what exactly counts as a center (in a way that those of the other two rules are not). Should we just\\ncount humans, or also pangolins or ants? What about ant colonies, or supercomputers, or proper parts (or temporal parts) of people? This is the\\nso-called “reference class problem” (see Bostrom 2002, chs. 10–11; see also\\n19\\n\\fArntzenius and Dorr, Manuscript).27\\nWe can summarize all of these rules as follows. Each rule has the effect\\nof multiplying the prior probability of each world w by some “confirmation\\nfactor” η(w), and then renormalizing. The confirmation factors for each\\nupdate rule are as follows.\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization\\nηCC (w) \\u0003\\n\\u001a\\n1\\nif there are any live centers in w\\n0\\notherwise\\nSelf Indication\\nηSI (w) \\u0003 the number of live centers in w\\nSelf Sampling For worlds w that contain any centers,\\nηSS (w) \\u0003 the proportion of live centers in w among all centers in w\\nOtherwise,\\nηSS (w) \\u0003 0\\nThat tells us everything we need to know about the posterior probabilities\\nof qualitative propositions. When it comes to self-locating probabilities,\\neach of these rules simply says to evenly divide the posterior probability of\\neach world w among the live centers in w.\\nWe can sum that up even more simply. Consider a set of mutually\\nexclusive qualitative hypotheses. Compartmentalized Conditionalization\\nrelatively confirms each hypothesis H in proportion to the conditional\\nprobability that there are any live centers, given H. Self Indication relatively confirms each hypothesis H in proportion to the expected number of\\nlive centers conditional on H. And Self Sampling relatively confirms each\\nhypothesis H according to the expected proportion of live centers among all\\ncenters, where this proportion is considered to be zero in worlds containing\\nno centers at all.\\n27The reason this problem does not arise for other views is that the number of dead centers\\nmakes no difference to the final probability. So, for example, if your evidence includes that\\nyou are human, pangolins and supercomputers don’t matter to the final calculation.\\n20\\n\\f5\\nFine-Tuning and Multiverses\\nWe now have three rules for dealing with self-locating evidence. Let’s\\nsee what each of them tells us about the significance of fine-tuning for the\\nmultiverse. (Again, we will generalize the results of this section in section 7.)\\nWe’ll start by working through some simple toy models. Suppose that\\nthe prior probability that there is exactly one universe is 2/3, and the prior\\nprobability that there is a multiverse consisting of exactly four universes is\\n1/3. Suppose that each “universe” consists of a single room, containing at\\nmost one agent (at just one time). Each room is one of four colors—black,\\nwhite, red, or green—each with equal prior probability. As in section 3,\\nwe suppose that what each universe is like—specifically, its color—is independent of what any other universes are like, on the prior. Each agent can\\ntell what color room they are in, and nothing more. You find yourself in a\\nblack room. This stands in for your “mundane” (but reasonably detailed)\\nevidence.\\nFirst, let’s get a feel for how things work out if life doesn’t need anything\\nlike fine-tuning: suppose that every universe is guaranteed to contain one\\nagent. We’ll add in fine-tuning after that. (The results of these calculations\\nare summarized in table 1 on page 24.)28\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization. The live centers correspond to\\nthe agents in black rooms. Given a single universe, the probability of\\nthere being such an agent is 1/4. Given a multiverse, the probability\\nof there being at least one such agent is 1 − (3/4)4 ≈ 0.68. So the\\nmultiverse is relatively confirmed by a factor of ≈ 2.7, bringing the\\nprobability from 1/3 to about 0.57. (From 1 : 2 odds to ≈ 2.7 : 2 odds.)\\nSelf Indication. Each hypothesis is relatively confirmed in proportion to its\\nexpected number of agents in black rooms. Given a single universe,\\nthis expected number is 1/4. Given a multiverse, this is 4 · (1/4) \\u0003 1.\\nSo the multiverse is relatively confirmed by a factor of 4, bringing its\\nprobability from 1/3 to 2/3. (From 1 : 2 odds to 4 : 2 odds.)\\nSelf Sampling. Since every world contains at least one agent in this model,\\neach hypothesis is weighted according to its expected proportion of\\n28There are various measures of strength of confirmation (see Fitelson 1999). Here we\\nfocus on the Bayes factor, which is the factor by which the odds of a hypothesis is increased\\nby evidence. (This is the same as the log-likelihood ratio Fitelson discusses, except on a linear\\nrather than a logarithmic scale.) Nothing important turns on this choice.\\n21\\n\\fblack-room agents among all agents. Whether there is a single universe or a multiverse, this expected proportion is 1/4. So the multiverse hypothesis is not confirmed, and its posterior probability stays\\nat 1/3.\\nThat was straightforward enough. Now let’s get a feel for how things\\nwork out if life is fine-tuned. Again, we’ll use a simple toy model. As before,\\nwe let the prior probability of a single universe be 2/3, and the probability\\nof a four-universe multiverse 1/3. As before, the probability of each color is\\n1/4 for each universe, and independent for different universes. This time,\\nlet the probability that each universe contains an agent be 1/10. Whether\\neach universe is inhabited is independent of its color and of what the other\\nuniverses are like.\\nAgain, you know this set-up, and you find yourself in a black room.\\nWhat probabilities should you assign? Again, we’ll take the three rules one\\nby one.\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization. Given a single universe, the probability of there being at least one agent in a black room is 1/10 · 1/4 \\u0003\\n1/40 \\u0003 0.025. Given a multiverse, this probability is 1 − (1 − 1/40)4 ≈\\n0.096. So the multiverse hypothesis is relatively confirmed by a factor\\nof ≈ 3.8, which takes its probability from 1/3 to a bit under 0.66.\\nSelf Indication. Given a single universe, the expected number of agents in\\nblack rooms is 1/40. Given a four-universe multiverse, this expectation is 4 · (1/40). So the multiverse hypothesis is relatively confirmed\\nby a factor of 4, bringing its probability from 1/3 to 2/3.\\nSelf Sampling. This is the most complicated one. Each world containing\\nagents gets weighted according to its proportion of agents in black\\nrooms, and the uninhabited worlds get zero weight. So we weigh\\neach of the rival hypotheses H by the probability it gives to there\\nbeing at least one agent, multiplied by the expected proportion of\\nagents in black rooms, conditional on H and there being at least one\\nagent. For either hypothesis, this conditional expectation is 1/4, so it\\ncan be cancelled out. Given a single universe, the probability of there\\nbeing at least one agent is the fine-tuning parameter 1/10. Given a\\nmultiverse, this probability is 1 − (1 − 1/10)4 ≈ 0.34. So the multiverse\\nis confirmed by a factor of ≈ 3.4, taking its probability from 1/3 to\\n≈ 0.63.\\n22\\n\\fLet’s sum up (see table 1). Self Indication says that the multiverse gets\\nconfirmed to exactly the same degree whether or not life is fine-tuned.\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization or Self Sampling both say that how\\nmuch the multiverse gets confirmed is sensitive to fine-tuning. Self Sampling gives no confirmation at all to the multiverse without fine-tuning, but\\nwith fine-tuning the multiverse gets a substantial boost. With Compartmentalized Conditionalization, the multiverse is confirmed even without\\nfine-tuning, but in the presence of fine-tuning it is confirmed even more.\\nThe general formulas for different parameters in this toy model are also\\ngiven in table 1.29\\nOne more observation. In section 3 we noted that highly specific purely\\nqualitative local evidence strongly confirms a multiverse, and we raised the\\npossibility that self-locating evidence might screen off this confirmation.\\nNow we can see that two of these three rules bear this out. Notice that the\\nformulas for Self Indication and Self Sampling in table 1 do not depend on\\nq: this means that in our simple setting, the specificity of one’s mundane\\nevidence makes no difference to how strongly a multiverse is confirmed.\\n(In the toy model, this mundane evidence is “I am in a black room,” and\\nq represents the probability that any given agent is in a black room.) So\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization is the only one of the three rules for\\nwhich the specificity of mundane evidence gives the multiverse a boost.\\n6\\nWhite on Self-Location\\nThe fact that some universe contains fine-tuned life is powerful evidence in\\nfavor of a large multiverse. As we discussed in section 3, additional local\\n29 How can we derive verdicts from Titelbaum’s CLF for these fine-tuning models? The\\nmost obvious approach is to use Titelbaum’s “technicolor” trick (see 2012, sec. 9.3 and\\n11.1.2). Consider a variant model where each universe is labeled with a number that can\\nbe clearly seen by any agent that inhabits it. In a multiverse, the universes are labeled 1 to\\nn. In a single universe, the universe is assigned a label between 1 and n at random (from\\na uniform distribution). It seems plausible that these labels do not make a difference to\\nthe probability one should assign to being in a multiverse (though we won’t argue for this\\nhere—and we note that unrestricted Compartmentalized Conditionalization does not agree\\nwith this judgment). In this modified case, there is sure to be at most one live center in each\\nworld: each universe contains only one center, and centers in different universes that might\\notherwise have been indistinguishable have been distinguished by being assigned different\\nlabels. In this case, CLF says to conditionalize on the evidence “Someone is in a black room\\nin universe k” (for whatever number 1 ≤ k ≤ n is observed). The probability of this holding\\nin a single universe is 1/n · pq, and the probability of this holding in a multiverse is pq, so\\nthe confirmation factor for the multiverse is n, with or without fine-tuning—the same as\\nwith Self Indication.

Setting aside\\nthe possibility of non-local evidence (and holding fixed the independence\\nassumptions in the background), the only hope for a single universe is\\nnon-qualitative evidence.\\nAs we discussed in section 2, Hacking (1987) and White (2000) argued\\nthat the key question is how the evidence that our universe has fine-tuned\\nlife makes a difference, over and above the evidence that some universe has\\nfine-tuned life. But while they pointed us to the right question, it is harder\\nto answer than either of them acknowledged. Hacking and White each\\nclaimed that our universe is no more likely to have fine-tuned life given the\\nexistence of a multiverse than it is given the existence of a single universe,\\nand thus that the fact that our universe has fine-tuned life does not confirm\\nthe existence of a multiverse. But it’s just not clear how to think about this.\\nFor a start, while we have helped ourselves to prior probabilities for qualitative hypotheses about the number of universes and their intrinsic profiles,\\nit is much more difficult to assess prior probabilities for propositions like our\\nuniverse has fine-tuned life. But this is what we would need to do in order to\\njustify the claim that this is independent of how many universes there are.\\nWe can hope to guide qualitative priors to a large extent by physical chances\\nor other measures that arise naturally within cosmology. But it is harder\\nto see how empirical physics might give us much direct guidance about\\n24\\n\\fself-locating prior probabilities.30 In fact, the three rules we have discussed\\ngive us purchase on claims about confirmation by self-locating evidence that\\ndoes not have to go through claims about prior probabilities of self-locating\\nevidence.\\nThat is not to say we think the project of identifying self-locating priors\\nis hopeless: we take it up in appendix B (see also Arntzenius and Dorr\\n2017). The way of thinking about things outlined there basically vindicates\\nwhat White calls the “Observation Principle”: “An observation I make gives\\nme evidence for hypothesis H only if it is more likely given H that I would\\nmake that observation” (White 2003, p. 244).31 Furthermore, each of the\\nself-locating rules we discussed in section 4 can be reinterpreted as recipes\\nfor generating self-locating priors from qualitative priors. But as it turns\\nout, none of these particular recipes generate priors that vindicate White’s\\nindependence claim—that whether our universe contains life is independent\\nof how many universes there are.\\nIn a postscript, White (2003) considers more seriously how self-location\\nmight make a difference to this issue. Here is what he says:\\nIt is not enough for confirmation that if my colleagues are rolling\\ndice, it is more likely that someone will see a double-six. If my\\nobservation is to provide me with evidence of these other rolls,\\nthey will have to make it more likely that I would observe this.\\n. . . What we need is a probabilistic link between my experiences\\nand the hypothesis in question. (White 2003, p. 244, original\\nemphasis)\\nHe then develops this idea in the voice of an interlocutor:\\n30But that might be too pessimistic: many-worlds quantum mechanics might do just that.\\n(For discussion of this interpretive project see, for instance, Greaves 2004). A solution to the\\n“measure problem” in inflationary cosmology might do the same.\\n31That principle is not quite right in cases of introspective failure (though this is not\\nespecially important in our present context). There may be cases where one observes\\noneself to be F, but is not aware of this observation. Let H be “It’s raining but I don’t observe\\nit.” Suppose I observe that it is raining, but don’t have this fact about my observation as\\nevidence. My observation that it is raining gives me the evidence that it is raining, which is\\nevidence for H. But the probability that I would observe that it is raining, given H, is zero.\\nThe correct principle is that the evidence I am F supports hypothesis H only if it is\\nmore likely given H that I would be F (whether or not I observe this). This principle is a\\nbasic fact about conditional probability, given that for E to be evidence for H means that\\nPr(H | E) > Pr(H)—including the case of self-locating evidence. We can apply this principle\\nto the special case where F is making a certain observation—in the ordinary case where one\\nhas evidence about one’s own observations.\\n25\\n\\f“. . . There are very many beings who could have been created\\nother than me. And I’m no more likely to be born in this universe\\nthan in any other. The more universes there are, the more living\\ncreatures there are. So the more opportunities I had to be picked\\nout of the pool of ‘possible beings,’ and hence the greater the\\nlikelihood that I should be observing anything.” (White 2003,\\np. 244, original emphasis)\\nThis suggestion basically amounts to the Self Indication idea. Before we\\ndiscuss White’s reply, let’s pause here. First, we don’t object to framing\\nthings in terms of a “probabilistic link” between one’s self-locating evidence\\nand the hypothesis—though we should beware of taking this too literally,\\nsince probabilistic dependence in the priors need not involve any kind of\\ncausal mechanism. But also, while White doesn’t explicitly say this, his\\nframing strongly implies that this Self Indication idea—that one is more\\nlikely to observe anything at all if there are more living creatures—is the\\nmost promising or the only way of establishing such a probabilistic link. We\\nshould be clear that this isn’t true. As we have just seen, Compartmentalized\\nConditionalization and Self Sampling also each provide the requisite “link”\\nbetween the multiverse and your own observations. (When translated into\\nself-locating priors, in simple models they each make it more likely that you\\nwould observe anything if there are many universes, when each universe\\nhas a low probability of life.) But neither of these rules builds in the idea\\nthat there being more people makes it more likely that you would observe\\nanything. They do each build in the idea that there being at least one\\nobserver makes it more likely that you would observe anything. But that\\nidea is surely right: after all, there being zero observers surely makes it less\\nlikely that you would observe anything.\\nHere is how White replies to the Self Indication suggestion:\\nThe metaphysical picture behind this story is dubious. But, quite\\napart from that, we can see that something must be wrong with\\nthis line of reasoning. The standard argument takes the fact that\\na universe must be extremely fine-tuned to support life, that a\\nrandom Big Bang has a very slim chance of producing life, as\\ncrucial to the case for multiple universes. If the current objector’s\\nargument is cogent, then it should go through regardless of the\\nneed for fine-tuning for life. That is, even if a universe with just\\nany set of fundamental constants is bound to produce life, we\\ncould still argue along these lines that the more universes there\\nare the more opportunities I had for existing and observing,\\n26\\n\\fand hence that my observations provide evidence for multiple\\nuniverses.\\nIndeed, if the objector’s argument is sound, then the discovery\\nthat a universe must meet very tight constraints in order to\\nsupport life should diminish the strength of the case for multiple\\nuniverses. For if every universe is bound to produce life, then\\nby increasing the number of universes we rapidly increase the\\nnumber of conscious beings, whereas if each universe has a\\nslim chance of producing life, then increasing the number of\\nuniverses increases the number of conscious beings less rapidly,\\nand hence (by the objector’s argument) increases the likelihood\\nof my existence less. I would be surprised if anyone wants to\\nendorse an argument with these consequences, but, at any rate,\\nit is not the standard one that takes the fine-tuning data to be\\ncrucial in the case for multiple universes. (White 2003, pp. 244–\\n245, original emphasis).\\nWhen White says that more stringent fine-tuning would diminish the strength\\nof the Self Indication argument for the multiverse, that’s a mistake. In our\\ntoy model we saw that the confirmation factor was n (the number of universes in the multiverse) regardless of the fine-tuning parameter. White’s\\nreasoning only gives half the story: it is correct that the smaller the finetuning parameter, the smaller the expected number of conscious beings\\ngiven a multiverse. But also, in the same way, the smaller the fine-tuning\\nparameter, the smaller the expected number of conscious beings given a\\nsingle universe. (The probability decreases that there will be any conscious\\nbeings at all.) These factors cancel out, leaving the confirmation the same\\nfor any fine-tuning parameter.\\nStill, White’s more central point in this passage is correct: fine-tuning\\ndoes not increase the strength of confirmation that the Self Indication rule\\ngives to the multiverse. So he’s right: the support that Self Indication gives\\nto the multiverse is not really a fine-tuning argument. It’s a different beast.\\nIn that way it comes apart from both of the other rules we considered.\\nIndeed, this feature of Self Indication—that it lends support to huge worlds\\nregardless of the details of our evidence—is one of the major objections it\\nfaces.\\nWe should distinguish two ideas. One is that being in a universe that\\ncontains fine-tuned life is strong evidence for the multiverse. The second\\nidea is that the fine-tuning part of this evidence plays a crucial role, over\\nand above being in a universe that contains life. All three of the rules we\\n27\\n\\fhave considered support the first conclusion (as will the broader theoretical\\nconsiderations we offer in section 7). But the second idea is less robust: it is\\nsupported by two of the three rules, but not Self Indication. Without doing\\nmore to adjudicate between different approaches to self-locating evidence,\\nthis is as much as we can say: the question remains pressing.\\nBut at least we can see that if fine-tuning does not provide support for\\nthe multiverse, it is not for the reason that Hacking and White defended.\\nFor their main arguments attack the first idea: both of them contend that our\\nuniverse contains fine-tuned life does not provide evidence for the multiverse\\nat all. For the kind of simple multiverse model we have all taken for granted\\n(with its independence assumptions), that evidence does support a multiverse, given any reasonable spelled-out theory of self-locating evidence that\\nwe know of.\\n7\\nTwo Multiverse Confirmation Theorems\\nThere are good reasons for dissatisfaction with each of Compartmentalized\\nConditionalization, Self Indication, and Self Sampling—but it is very hard\\nto come up with a more satisfactory alternative. This topic is hard. In the\\nabsence of clarity about the correct self-locating epistemology, we should\\ntake a step back and ask whether some other rule might go differently.\\nMight there be some reasonable rule among those we haven’t thought of\\nthat doesn’t say that, in the presence of fine-tuning, self-locating evidence\\nsupports a multiverse? One might hope so. According to Self Indication,\\nthe multiverse is no more strongly confirmed with fine-tuning than without\\nfine-tuning. According to Self Sampling, the multiverse is not confirmed\\nwithout fine-tuning. So one might hope to come up with a single theory that\\ncombines both of these features; such a theory would say that a multiverse\\nis not confirmed even with fine-tuning. Is there any reasonable theory like\\nthis?\\nWe present two mathematical results that constrain any theory of selflocating evidence—and which strongly suggest that the answer to this question is no. We relegate the technical details to appendix A; here we will state\\nthe results informally and briefly sketch the main ideas of their proofs.\\n(Appendix B extends these results to the framework of self-locating priors.)\\nWe are now considering abstractly any kind of theory that gives answers to the following kind of question: given certain prior probabilities\\nover qualitative hypotheses, and given that you are in a certain qualitative\\nevidential situation, what posterior probabilities should you assign to qual-\\n28\\n\\fitative hypotheses? The theories we considered in sections 4 and 5 are\\nexamples of such theories, but those theories are quite constrained. For\\ninstance, each of those theories assigns the same probability to any two\\ncenters in the same qualitative world that are both compatible with one’s\\nself-locating evidence.32 This principle looks suspect in general. For example, in Everettian quantum mechanics, there is a certain physical quantity\\nof “amplitude” or “branch-weight” that ought to make a difference to the\\nepistemic probability of being in one branch of the quantum wave function\\nor another (see for example Greaves 2004; Sebens and Carroll 2016; see also\\ndiscussion in Titelbaum 2012, pp. 275–276). Two different centers in the\\nsame quantum multiverse can each be consistent with one’s evidence, but\\nshould not be assigned the same probability because they are on branches\\nwith different quantum amplitudes. A different kind of challenge comes\\nfrom conceptions of evidence that do not just separate “live” and “dead”\\ncenters, but treat this distinction as a matter of degree (for example, views\\nin the spirit of Jeffrey 1983). There are also many approaches to puzzles\\nabout time or memory loss (such as the Sleeping Beauty puzzle), some of\\nwhich work quite differently from the rules we considered in section 4 (see\\nthe references in section 4). Still, all such views that we know of (insofar\\nas they give precise answers to the question in the form we have posed it)\\nare compatible with the abstract framework of this section. Whatever those\\nviews might say about other puzzles, the theorems we will present here\\nconstrain what they say about fine-tuning and the multiverse.\\nWe suppose there is a prior probability distribution over qualitative\\nhypotheses. We consider qualitative priors which have a certain simple\\nform, which builds in the same kind of independence assumptions that\\nHacking and White supposed, and which we have deployed throughout.\\nHere is the picture. There is a certain probability distribution over possible\\nintrinsic profiles of a universe. However many universes there may be, each\\nuniverse’s intrinsic profile is independent and identically distributed: that\\nis, for each universe u, no matter how many other universes there are, and\\nno matter what their intrinsic profiles are like, the probability of u having\\na certain intrinsic profile is given by this same distribution. We call priors\\nlike this separable. The official definition of separability is stated in terms\\nof prior probabilities for purely qualitative hypotheses, rather than (as the\\ninformal gloss suggested) giving an official place to prior de re probabilities\\n32Compare the “highly restricted principle of indifference” of (Elga 2000, p. 144; see also\\nElga 2004): “Since being in T1 is subjectively just like being in T2 , and since exactly the same\\n[qualitative] propositions are true whether you are in T1 or T2 , . . . you ought to have equal\\ncredence in each.”\\n29\\n\\fabout particular universes. This involves some technicalities, discussed in\\nappendix A. The fine-tuning parameter p is the probability of there being any\\ncenters at all, given a single universe.\\nThis picture is clearly an idealization. For one thing, the multiple universes that appear in contemporary physics are not entirely separate and\\nindependent of one another. For another, it could be entirely reasonable\\nto expect different intrinsic properties for an isolated universe than one expects from a universe in a multiverse. For example, one might allocate some\\nprior probability to a theistic hypothesis, according to which God does not\\ncare much about how many universes there are, but is adamant that at least\\none universe contains life. In that case, a universe that is part of a large\\nmultiverse might be much less likely to contain life than a single isolated\\nuniverse. We do not mean to suggest that separable priors are realistic. But\\nseeing how things go in this especially simple idealized case is illuminating.\\nWe also consider an idealizing constraint on evidence. So far we have\\nfocused on views of evidence according to which it consists in propositions\\nof the form “I am now F,” which we have represented by way of properties\\nof agents. But the limiting theorems apply to a much wider range of views\\nabout self-locating evidence. For the purposes of these theorems, we can\\nbe almost entirely neutral about which features of agents are relevant to the\\nposterior probabilities they should have. We will abstractly consider a relation of evidential equivalence between centers: intuitively, this means that the\\nagents of the two centers are exactly alike in whatever respects are relevant\\nto the probabilities they should assign to qualitative hypotheses. This might\\nrequire that they share phenomenology, or knowledge, or other properties\\nconcerning their psychologies, histories, environments, or constitutions.\\nThe main substantive assumption we will make about this relation is that\\nit is local, in the following sense. Say two possible universes are evidentially\\nequivalent iff there is a one-to-one correspondence between the centers in\\nthe two universes that takes each center in one universe to an evidentially\\nequivalent center in the other.\\nLocality. Intrinsic duplicate universes are evidentially equivalent.\\nFor an internalist who holds that intrinsic duplicate agents are evidentially\\nequivalent, Locality follows automatically.33 But Locality is much weaker\\n33This also assumes the modest supervenience principle that any duplication map from\\none universe to another maps each agent in the first universe to an agent in the other.\\nIntuitively, whether something counts as an agent doesn’t depend on anything beyond its\\nuniverse.\\n30\\n\\fthan internalism. The basic idea is that even if evidence “ain’t in the head,”\\nit is at least “in the universe.”\\nAgain, Locality is an idealization. One might well assign some prior\\nprobability to non-local evidence. If phenomenal states are evidence, one\\nmight assign some prior probability to the hypothesis that the content of\\none’s phenomenal states is partially determined by what goes on in other\\nuniverses. If knowledge is evidence, one might assign some prior probability to coming to know whether or not there is a multiverse. But it is\\na reasonable simplification to set such possibilities aside, and it would be\\nsurprising if the true theory of multiverse epistemology crucially relied on\\nnon-local evidence.\\nFinally we consider two constraints on posterior probabilities. One idea is\\nthat confirmation only depends on evidentially relevant features of worlds\\n(whatever those features might be). We say two worlds are evidentially equivalent iff there is a one-to-one correspondence between the inhabited universes\\nin the two worlds that takes each inhabited universe in one to an evidentially equivalent universe in the other. Given a prior, we call a posterior\\nevidential iff no world is confirmed relative to any evidentially equivalent\\nworld. The idea is that if something makes a difference to relative probabilities, it should show up somewhere in a world’s distribution of “evidential\\nsituations”, however we are thinking about that notion. (As usual, when we\\nsay “H1 is confirmed relative to H2 ,” we mean that the ratio of the posterior\\nprobability of H1 to the posterior probability of H2 is greater than their ratio\\nof prior probabilities.)\\nFinally, we only consider agents who can tell that there is at least one\\nagent.\\nAgents. The posterior probability that there are no agents is zero.\\nThere are two main results. The first concerns “small enough” multiverses.\\nTheorem 1. For any separable qualitative prior and any evidential posterior, Locality and Agents imply that, for any possible multiverse size\\n1 < n < 1/p, where p is the fine-tuning parameter, the proposition\\nthere are n universes is confirmed relative to there is just one universe.\\nProof Sketch. We’ll illustrate with the case n \\u0003 2. In this case, the hypothesis\\nis that the fine-tuning parameter p < 1/2. The main idea of the proof is to\\nconsider how things go if we know exactly one universe is inhabited. Let\\n31\\n\\fU n be the proposition there are exactly n universes. Let I1 be the proposition\\nexactly one universe is inhabited.\\nFirst, for a separable prior Pr(−), a little calculation shows that if p < 1/2,\\nthen it is more probable that exactly one universe is inhabited if there are\\ntwo universes than if there is just one. (For two universes this probability is\\n2p(1 − p), while for one universe it is p.)\\nSecond, we have a lemma that says that, given the number of inhabited universes, our self-locating evidence tells us nothing about how many\\nuninhabited universes there are (lemma 5 in appendix A). So, conditional\\non exactly one universe being inhabited, neither U1 nor U2 is confirmed\\nrelative to the other.\\nThird, on the posterior we know that if there is just one universe, then it\\nis inhabited. So U1 I1 has the same posterior probability as U1 , while U2 I1\\nis no more probable than U2 .\\nPut these three steps together, and we’re done:\\nPr(U2 ) Pr(U2 I1 ) Pr∗ (U2 I1 )\\nPr∗ (U2 )\\n<\\n\\u0003\\n≤\\nPr(U1 ) Pr(U1 I1 ) Pr∗ (U1 I1 )\\nPr∗ (U1 )\\nThat is, U2 is confirmed relative to U1 .\\n\\u0003\\nTheorem 1 tells us that for any n, there is some fine-tuning parameter\\np for which a size-n multiverse is confirmed. So a multiverse of any finite\\nsize is confirmed by fine-tuned life—as long as it is fine-tuned enough.\\nOur second result generalizes to arbitrarily large multiverses; but it relies\\non a principle whose status does not seem nearly as clear as the others. The\\nidea is that without any fine-tuning, our evidence does not disconfirm a\\nmultiverse. We say a posterior is ordinary iff, for each n > 0, conditional on\\nevery universe containing agents, the existence of just one universe is not\\nconfirmed relative to the existence of n universes.\\nPosteriors that are not ordinary seem a bit odd (in a context of separable\\npriors and local evidence). If we suppose that every universe has life, but\\neach universe’s internal configuration is independent of any other’s, and\\nour evidence only directly tells us about our universe’s internal configuration, then it’s not clear why we would think that our evidence favors a\\nsingle universe. That’s not to say it couldn’t turn out this way. Indeed, this\\ncan happen with Self Sampling. If our evidence indicates that our universe\\nhas a relatively small population, compared to the expected population size\\nof an arbitrary inhabited universe, then the expected proportion of centers\\ncompatible with our evidence is higher for a single universe than it is for\\na multiverse. So this kind of evidence would favor a single universe over\\n32\\n\\fa multiverse, by Self Sampling. (Perhaps we even have this kind of evidence: looking around, one might take our own universe to be surprisingly\\nsparsely inhabited, compared to what one might expect from an inhabited\\nuniverse.)34\\nWe put forward “ordinariness” in a different spirit from the other constraints we have discussed. It is not a very plausible constraint on what\\nposteriors have to be like in general. It is also not really a simplifying idealization like separability or locality. But theorem 2 tells us something interesting: given the other assumptions, the only way that a large multiverse\\ncan fail to be confirmed in the presence of fine-tuning is if our posteriors are\\n“extraordinary,” which is to say (roughly) that in the absence of fine-tuning\\na multiverse is disconfirmed. (Furthermore, the proof of the theorem shows\\nus that for large n and small p, the only way to avoid confirming a multiverse is if, in the absence of fine-tuning, our evidence strongly disconfirms a\\nmultiverse.)\\nThis again tells against Hacking and White’s diagnosis of the fine-tuning\\nargument. If they were right, then our evidence should not count against a\\nmultiverse, either—even in the absence of fine-tuning. (If it is clear that this\\nroll of the dice coming up double sixes does not support there being many\\nrolls, it is even clearer that, conditional on every roll coming up double\\nsixes, this roll of the dice coming up double sixes does not support there\\nbeing just one roll of the dice!)\\nTheorem 2. For any separable prior and any ordinary evidential posterior,\\nLocality and Agents imply that for any possible multiverse size n > 1,\\nthere are n universes is confirmed relative to there is just one universe.\\nThe proof uses similar ideas to theorem 1. For each 1 ≤ k ≤ n, we\\ncan show that there are n universes exactly k of which are inhabited is not\\ndisconfirmed relative to there is one inhabited universe (for separable priors,\\nlocal evidence, and ordinary evidential posteriors). It follows that there are\\nn universes and at least one universe is inhabited is not disconfirmed relative\\nto there is one inhabited universe. But the prior probability that at least one\\nuniverse is inhabited is higher if there are many universes than if there is\\njust one. For the rest of the argument see appendix A.\\n34The argument of Olum (2004) is closely related.\\n33\\n\\f8\\nConclusion\\nThe existence of fine-tuned life, taken on its own, is straightforwardly evidence for a multiverse. But this mere qualitative evidence should not be\\ntaken on its own: our relevant evidence is not just that there is some finetuned life or other, but that we ourselves are fine-tuned life. This can make\\na difference. We have also evaluated a seductive argument that this more\\nspecific evidence does not confirm the multiverse. Some standard rules\\nfor self-locating probabilities do not vindicate this idea. What’s more, our\\ngeneral results show that it will be difficult to come up with any reasonable\\ntheory that does vindicate it. If being in a universe with fine-tuned life is not\\nevidence for the existence of a multiverse, then some principle in the multiverse confirmation theorems must fail: in the case of “small” multiverses,\\nthis means that priors are not separable, evidence is not local, or posteriors\\nare not evidential. This is not to end the debate, but it provides a framework\\nin which to continue it. A duel of conflicting intuitive analogies won’t cut it:\\nclear reasoning about the strength of our evidence for a multiverse requires\\nsystematic theorizing about self-locating evidence.\\nA\\nTheorems and Proofs\\nHere we present precise statements and proofs of the two theorems in\\nsection 7.\\nDefinition 1. A multiverse structure consists of the following components.\\n1. A non-empty set W of possible worlds.\\n2. A non-empty set I of centers.\\n3. A non-empty set U of (possible) universes. Each universe is in exactly\\none world, and each center is in exactly one universe.\\n4. An equivalence relation between universes of intrinsic duplication.\\n5. An equivalence relation between centers of evidential equivalence.\\nIn what follows we restrict attention to the case where W and I are both\\ncountable. (This relaxes the assumption in section 4 of only finitely many\\nworlds or centers.) We are thinking of worlds as specified qualitatively. A\\n(qualitative) proposition is a set of worlds.\\n34\\n\\f(In supposing that every center is in a universe, we set aside the a priori\\npossibility of being an immaterial agent like an angel or a god. This is\\nanother idealization.)\\nDefinition 2. For any multiverse structure,\\n(a) A universe u is inhabited iff there is at least one center in u.\\n(b) For any number n, U n is the proposition that there are exactly n\\nuniverses (that is, the set of worlds w such that there are exactly n\\nuniverses in w).\\n(c) For any number n, I n is the proposition that there are exactly n inhabited universes.\\nWe can use the evidential equivalence relation on centers to define closely\\nrelated relations on universes and worlds.\\nDefinition 3.\\n(a) Universes u and u 0 are evidentially equivalent iff there is a one-to-one\\ncorrespondence f from the centers in u to the centers in u 0 such that\\ni is evidentially equivalent to f (i) for each center i in u.\\n(b) Worlds w and w 0 are evidentially equivalent iff there is a one-to-one\\ncorrespondence f from the inhabited universes in w to the inhabited\\nuniverses in w 0 such that u is evidentially equivalent to f (u) for each\\nuniverse u in w.\\n(c) A multiverse structure is local iff any pair of intrinsic duplicate universes are evidentially equivalent.\\nLet a qualitative prior Pr(−) on a multiverse structure be a (countably\\nadditive) probability function on the set of all qualitative propositions. We\\nwill only consider priors with a certain simple structure. The intuitive idea\\nis that there is a distribution over possible intrinsic profiles of a universe,\\nand that each universe is assigned an intrinsic profile at random from this\\ndistribution: so the profiles of all of the universes in a world are independent and identically distributed. This is a bit difficult to state officially in\\npurely qualitative terms: the most natural way of doing it would presuppose “trans-world identity” for possible universes, which our model does\\nnot build in. But there is a fairly straightforward way of describing the\\nqualitative probability distribution that corresponds to this picture.\\n35\\n\\fA first pass at the idea is that the probability of any particular qualitative\\nprofile of a multiverse, given its number of universes, is the product of the\\nprobabilities of the various individual universe-profiles that make it up.\\nThis isn’t quite right, though, because sometimes there is more than one\\nway to get a qualitative profile. If you roll two fair dice, the probability of\\nrolling a five and a six is twice the probability of two sixes. While there\\nis only one way to roll two sixes, there are two ways to get a five and six:\\nthe pairs (5, 6) and (6, 5). Independent universe profiles should have the\\nsame structure. In general, the number of different ways to get a sequence\\nof n things, which includes d distinct elements repeated k 1 , . . . , k d times,\\nrespectively, is\\nn!\\nk1 ! · · · k d !\\nThis is the number of permutations of n indices, with permutations that\\ntake elements to indistinguishable elements quotiented out.\\nFor a sequence of possible universes (u 1 , . . . u n ), let the local profile\\n[u1 · · · u n ] be the set of worlds w such that there are distinct universes\\nv1 , . . . v n in w which are duplicates of u1 , . . . , u n , respectively. Intuitively\\nthis proposition says that the multiverse includes a copy of a (u 1 , . . . , u n )\\nmultiverse.\\nDefinition 4. Call a qualitative prior Pr(−) on a multiverse frame separable\\niff it satisfies the following three conditions.\\n(a) We say n is a possible multiverse size iff Pr(U n ) > 0. For any numbers\\n1 ≤ k ≤ n, if n is a possible multiverse size, then k is a possible\\nmultiverse size as well.35\\n(b) Let n be any possible multiverse size, and let u1 , . . . , u n be a sequence of possible universes. Suppose that this sequence represents\\nd different equivalence classes under duplication, which are repeated\\nk 1 , . . . , k d times in the sequence respectively. Then:\\nPr([u1 , . . . , u n ] | U n ) \\u0003\\nn!\\nPr([u 1 ] | U1 ) · · · Pr([u n ] | U1 )\\nk1 ! · · · k d !\\n(c) The fine-tuning parameter p \\u0003 Pr(I1 | U1 ) satisfies 0 < p < 1.\\n35The main purpose of this “regularity” condition is to avoid division by zero, especially\\nin lemma 1 (a) and the proof of theorem 2.

Pr∗ (I0 ) \\u0003 0\\nThe second idea is that if two worlds are alike in every evidentially\\nrelevant respect, then neither is confirmed over the other.\\nDefinition 6. Let Pr(−) be a qualitative prior. We call a posterior Pr∗ (−) evidential iff no pair of evidentially equivalent worlds is relatively confirmed:\\nthat is, for any evidentially equivalent worlds w 1 and w2 , w 1 ∼∗ w2 .\\nWe can immediately rewrite this in a more general form.\\n39\\n\\fLemma 4. For any qualitative prior and any evidential posterior, if E is a set\\nof pairwise evidentially equivalent worlds, for any propositions A and B, AE is\\nnot confirmed relative to BE; or in other words, A is not confirmed relative to B\\nconditional on E.\\nProof. If Pr(E) \\u0003 0 then we are done by lemma 3 (a). Otherwise, there is\\nsome world w ∈ E such that Pr(w) > 0. (Here we use our assumption that\\nthe set of worlds W is countable.) The proposition A E is partitioned by the\\nset of worlds v ∈ A E. Each world v ∈ A E is evidentially equivalent to w,\\nso we know that v ∼∗ w. By lemma 3 (c), A E ∼∗ w. By parallel reasoning,\\nw ∼∗ B E. So A E ∼∗ B E by lemma 3 (b).\\n\\u0003\\nLemma 5. Let Pr(−) be a separable qualitative prior on a local multiverse structure,\\nand let Pr∗ (−) be an evidential posterior. For any possible multiverse sizes m and\\nn, U n is not confirmed relative to U m conditional on I k .\\nProof. Let Q be the set of distinct local profiles Q \\u0003 [u1 · · · u k ] where\\n(u 1 , . . . , u k ) is a sequence of inhabited universes and Pr(Q) > 0. These\\npropositions are mutually exclusive.\\nConsider any Q ∈ Q. Any two worlds in I k Q are evidentially equivalent: each of the k inhabited universes in one world can be mapped to a\\nduplicate universe in the other, and locality says that duplicate universes\\nare evidentially equivalent. Thus lemma 4 tells us that neither of U n or U m\\nis relatively confirmed conditional on I k Q. So we have\\nPr∗ (U n I k Q) · Pr(U m I k Q) \\u0003 Pr∗ (U m I k Q) · Pr(U n I k Q)\\nLemma 2 tells us:\\nPr(Q | U n I k ) \\u0003 Pr(Q | U m I k )\\nAnd so:\\nPr(U n I k Q) · Pr(U m I k ) \\u0003 Pr(U m I k Q) · Pr(U n I k )\\nMultiplying these two equations together and canceling the (non-zero) factor Pr(U n I k Q) · Pr(U m I k Q) we find:\\nPr∗ (U n I k Q) · Pr(U m I k ) \\u0003 Pr∗ (U m I k Q) · Pr(U n I k )\\nThe conclusion follows by lemma 3 (d).\\n\\u0003\\nTheorem 1. Let Pr(−) be a separable qualitative prior on a local multiverse structure, and let Pr∗ (−) be an evidential posterior that satsfies Agents. For any possible\\nmultiverse size n, if 1 < n < 1/p, where p is the fine-tuning parameter, then U n\\nis confirmed relative to U1 .\\n40\\n\\fProof. If Pr∗ (U1 ) \\u0003 0 then we’re done; so suppose Pr∗ (U1 ) > 0. By Agents\\n(and the fact that U1 entails I0 ∨ I1 ) we have Pr∗ (U1 I1 ) \\u0003 Pr∗ (U1 ) > 0.

Given a qualitative prior Pr(−) on a multiverse structure, say\\na posterior Pr∗ (−) is ordinary iff for any possible multiverse size n, U1 is\\nnot confirmed relative to U n conditional on every universe being inhabited.\\nThat is, a posterior Pr∗ (−) is ordinary iff for each n such that Pr(U n ) > 0,\\nU n I n %∗ U 1 I 1\\nTheorem 2. Let Pr(−) be a separable qualitative prior on a local multiverse structure. Let Pr∗ (−) be an ordinary evidential posterior that satisfies Agents. For any\\npossible multiverse size n > 1, U n is confirmed relative to U1 .\\nProof. Suppose 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The conditions on a separable prior tell us that\\nPr(U k I k ) > 0 So by lemma 5, ordinariness, and lemma 3 (b),\\nU n I k ∼∗ U k I k % ∗ U 1 I 1\\nThe propositions I1 , . . . , I n partition U n ¬I0 , so by lemma 3 (c),\\nU n ¬I0 %∗ U1 I1\\nFinally,\\nPr∗ (U n ) Pr∗ (U n ¬I0 )\\n\\u0003\\nPr∗ (U1 )\\nPr∗ (U1 I1 )\\nPr(U n ¬I0 )\\n≥\\nPr(U1 I1 )\\nPr(¬I0 | U n ) Pr(U n )\\n\\u0003\\nPr(¬I0 | U1 ) Pr(U1 )\\nPr(U n )\\n>\\nPr(U1 )\\n41\\nby Agents\\nas shown above\\nlemma 1 (c)\\n\\u0003\\n\\fThe proof also gives us a lower bound on the strength of confirmation.\\nFor separable priors, the probability Pr(¬I0 | U n ) of at least one universe\\nbeing inhabited if there are n universes total is 1 − (1 − p)n , where p is the\\nfine-tuning parameter.\\nCorollary 1. Let Pr(−) be a separable prior, and let Pr∗ (−) be an ordinary evidential\\nposterior that satisfies Agents. For any possible multiverse size n, either Pr∗ (U1 ) \\u0003\\n0 or else\\n\\u0012\\n\\u0013\\nPr∗ (U n )\\nPr(U n ) 1 − (1 − p)n\\n≥\\np\\nPr∗ (U1 )\\nPr(U1 )\\nwhere p is the fine-tuning parameter. For large n, this confirmation factor approaches 1/p.\\nIn other words, for separable priors and ordinary evidential posteriors,\\nself-locating evidence confirms a multiverse at least as strongly as the qualitative evidence “There is life” does.\\nB\\nSelf-Locating Priors\\nIn appendix A we only considered prior and posterior probabilities for\\nqualitative hypotheses. It’s worth thinking about how we can apply a more\\ntraditional Bayesian model. If there are also self-locating prior probabilities—\\nnot just prior probabilities of the qualitative world being a certain way, but\\nprior probabilities of you yourself being a certain way—then updating can\\nproceed in the traditional way: by conditionalizing the self-locating prior\\non one’s self-locating total evidence. These priors need not represent any\\nperson’s primordial credences (no more than the qualitative priors do);\\nrather they would be “ur-priors” that encode facts about evidential support\\n(see Meacham 2016, and references therein; Arntzenius and Dorr 2017).\\nThe difficulty is in figuring out what those self-locating prior probabilities\\nshould look like.\\nFirst a few preliminaries. While in appendix A we could afford to be\\nextremely non-committal about the nature of self-locating evidence, for this\\nsection we take the more opinionated stand that one’s self-locating evidence\\nis the sort of thing that can be conditionalized on. As we discussed in\\nsection 4, we can theorize about a proposition expressed by a sentence “I\\nam now F” by way of the property of being F, which we can represent as\\na set of centers. To make this precise, we deploy some standard tools from\\nepistemic logic—with centers taking center stage, rather than worlds.\\nDefinition 8. A (centered) frame consists of the following:\\n42\\n\\f1. A non-empty set W of worlds.\\n2. A non-empty set I of centers. Each center is in exactly one world.\\n3. A relation of evidential accessibility between centers. We write E(i)\\nfor the set of centers that are accessible from i.\\nWhat it intuitively means for a center j to be evidentially accessible from\\na center i is that one’s self-locating evidence at i is consistent with being\\nat j.36 To put that another way, we can consider the conjunction of all\\nproperties being F which are part of agent a’s self-locating evidence at time\\nt in world w. This property is represented by a set of centers, which is the\\nset E(i) where i is the center ha, t, wi.\\nIt is common to take for granted that a center j is compatible with the\\nevidence at i if and only if one has the same evidence at j as at i, so i and j rule\\nout precisely the same centers. This amounts to supposing that evidential\\naccessibility is an equivalence relation, which amounts to a strong access\\nprinciple to the effect that one can always tell what one’s evidence is (see for\\nexample Williamson 2000, ch. 10; Salow 2018) But this assumption is highly\\ncontentious, and unnecessary for the results that follow; we do not make\\nit.37\\nEven though we are not assuming that evidential accessibility is an\\nequivalence relation, we can use it to define a closely related equivalence\\nrelation:\\n• Centers i and j are evidentially equivalent iff E(i) \\u0003 E( j) and for any\\ncenter k, i ∈ E(k) iff j ∈ E(k).\\nThis is the weakest equivalence relation that is extended by the accessibility\\nrelation. Thus we can let a multiverse frame be a multiverse structure in\\nthe sense of definition 1, together with an accessibility relation on centers,\\n36To be more explicit, if i \\u0003 ha, t, wi and j \\u0003 ha 0 , t 0 , w 0 i, this means that being the\\nqualitative way a is at t in w implies having only evidence that is compatible with being the\\nqualitative way a 0 is at t 0 in w 0 .\\n37For example, some contend that an agent’s evidence is what they know (Williamson\\n2000, ch. 9). Moreover, it’s commonplace to say that an agent with hands knows that they\\nare not a handless brain-in-a-vat with misleading appearances, and that a handless brainin-a-vat with misleading experiences does not know whether they are an agent with hands\\nor a handless brain-in-a-vat with misleading appearances. Then the access principle would\\nfail. Skeptical hypotheses like these are particularly poignant in the context of cosmology:\\nif the world may well be vast, the chance of there really being many agents in unfortunate\\nskeptical predicaments—like “Boltzmann brains”—is not negligible.\\n43\\n\\fwhere the structure’s evidential equivalence relation is defined in terms of\\naccessibility in this way.\\nNow let’s think about self-locating priors. Consider a simple case. There\\nare three cards, reading Zero, One, and Two. One of them is drawn by a fair\\nchance process. If Zero is drawn, there will be no agents; if One, then\\nthere will be exactly one person in a black room; if Two, there will be\\nexactly two people in black rooms. It is straightforward enough that each\\nof these three qualitative scenarios should have prior 1/3. But self-locating\\nprior probabilities are much murkier. It isn’t clear how to come up with\\nreasonable prior probabilities for propositions like that expressed by “There\\nis exactly one person, and it’s me.” No objective chance was specified for\\nthis, and it’s a bit mysterious how to even think about it—now we also need\\nto assign some prior probability to the alternative proposition expressed by\\n“There is exactly one person, and it isn’t me.”\\nThe way forward is to take this seriously: we can assign prior probabilities to not being a person or an agent at all. This might have been\\nso—indeed, there might have been no one at all. And the fact that there are\\nagents—and that you are one of them—can do significant evidential work,\\nsupporting some hypotheses over others. The ur-prior encodes this kind of\\npotential to do evidential work.\\nThere are two different ways of thinking about what it is like not to be an\\nagent: contingentism and necessitism. The contingentist holds that one might\\nhave been nothing whatsoever—and so not an agent. The necessitist holds\\nthat, come what may, one would have been something—but this something\\nmight have been a very boring non-concrete object, without any thoughts\\nor feelings or spatiotemporal location. In either case, one would not have\\nbeen an agent. We will describe possibilities in these neutral terms, rather\\nthan using more loaded language about whether one would have existed.\\n(To be clear, the relevant modality here is prior epistemic possibility, rather\\nthan metaphysical possibility. But the structural issue is the same either\\nway.)\\nThe self-locating prior approach requires an innovation (borrowed from\\nfamiliar models for free logics). In addition to the “agent-centers”, in each\\nworld there is one additional null center, which represents the possibility of\\nnot being an agent.38 We suppose that the evidential accessibility relation is\\ndefined only on non-null centers: substantively, this is to assume that one\\n38We use just one null center per world because it is simple and sufficient for our application, but other applications might call for assigning each world an “outer domain” that\\ncontains many distinct “null centers.” Null centers need not be anything exotic: they might\\njust be triples hx, t, wi where x is not an agent.\\n44\\n\\fis sure to have evidence that entails being an agent, if one is an agent at all.\\n(This is another idealization.)\\nJust as we modeled self-locating evidence as a set of centers, we can\\nextend this to self-locating prior and posterior probabilities as well. A selflocating prior Pr(−) is a probability measure defined for all sets of centers,\\nrepresenting the prior probability of being one way or another.\\nIn appendix A we modeled qualitative propositions as sets of worlds.\\nWe can straightforwardly associate each set of worlds X with a boring set\\nof centers: namely, those centers that are in some world in X (including\\nthe null centers). Given a self-locating prior Pr(−), we can thus read off\\na qualitative prior Prq (−) by considering the probabilities of boring sets of\\ncenters.\\nAmong the properties we are interested in are properties that do not\\nentail being an agent. The set of centers that represents such a property\\nwill include some null centers. This is important, since we want to assign\\nnon-zero prior probabilities to qualitative propositions like there are no agents,\\nand thus also to qualitative properties like being such that there are no agents\\nor more simply not being an agent. No agent in any world has either of these\\nproperties. The positive prior probability that properties like these receive\\ncan only come from the positive prior probabilities of null centers.\\nIn this setting, we can get self-locating posterior probabilities by just\\nconditionalizing on one’s self-locating evidence.\\nDefinition 9. Let Pr(−) be a self-locating prior on a centered frame. For\\nany (non-null) center i such that Pr(E(i)) > 0, we define the self-locating\\nposterior\\nPri (−) \\u0003 Pr(− | E(i))\\n(where as before E(i) is the set of centers that are evidentially accessible\\nfrom i).\\nWe can reconstrue rules like Compartmentalized Conditionalization,\\nSelf Indication, and Self Sampling in this framework. These rules took\\nfor granted that the posterior is determined by a qualitative prior together\\nwith indexical evidence. In this framework, such rules can be reinterpreted\\nas rules for mapping a qualitative prior Prq (−) to an indexical prior Pr(−)\\nthat enriches Prq (−). (That is, Pr(−) assigns the same probability to each\\nboring set of centers as Prq (−) assigns to its associated set of worlds.) The\\nself-locating posterior is then given by conditionalization.\\nFor simplicity we restrict attention here to the case where there are\\n45\\n\\fonly finitely many worlds containing finitely many centers.39 In order to\\nspecify enriched self-locating priors, it’s enough to specify the conditional\\nprobability Pr(i | w) for each center i in world w. (Here i and w stand for\\nthe obvious corresponding sets of centers.) The probability of an arbitrary\\nqualitative property P can then be calculated as\\nPr(P) \\u0003\\nÕ\\nPr(i | w) Prq (w)\\nw∈W\\ni∈P\\nFurthermore, it suffices to define Pr(i | w) for each non-null center i in a\\nworld w. We just choose Pr(j | w) for the null center j so that the conditional\\nprobabilities add up to one. Here are the recipes for generating self-locating\\npriors corresponding to each of the three rules we have discussed.\\nSelf Sampling. For any non-null center i in world w,\\nPr(i | w) \\u0003\\n1\\nn(w)\\nwhere n(w) is the number of non-null centers in w.\\nThe prior probability of each world containing non-null centers is\\nevenly divided among those centers. Worlds that only have a null\\ncenter put all their probability there.\\nSelf Indication. For any non-null center i in world w,\\nPr(i | w) \\u0003\\n1\\nN\\nwhere N is the maximum number of non-null centers in any world.\\nThe idea is that when there are fewer agents in a world, there is more\\nprior probability left over for the null center.\\nCompartmentalized Conditionalization. This case is more delicate: there\\nis a formula that works in cases where the structure of possible evidence is especially simple, but not in general. It suffices for the\\nevidential accessibility relation to be an equivalence relation. In that\\n39In fact, even if there are infinitely many worlds, the same formulas will work as long as\\nthe number of centers per world is bounded. (For Compartmentalized Conditionalization, let\\nT be the maximum number of evidential types in any world, instead of the total number of\\nevidential types.) The Self-Sampling recipe continues to work even if the number of centers\\nper world is finite but unbounded.\\n46\\n\\fcase, each non-null center i has a unique evidential type: there is a\\nunique set of centers E(j) (for any center j) that includes i. Let t(i) be\\nthe number of centers in i’s world that are of the same evidential type\\nas i.40 Let T be the total number of distinct evidential types. For any\\nnon-null center i in world w,\\nPr(i | w) \\u0003\\n1\\nt(i) T\\nThe idea is that the prior probability of a world is first evenly divided\\namong all evidential types, and then each type’s probability is evenly\\ndivided again among its centers in that world. The probability of a\\ntype that has no centers in a world all goes to the null center.\\nThese indexical priors agree with the original rules, in the following sense.\\nStart with any qualitative prior Prq (−). If you generate a self-locating prior\\nusing the rule’s recipe above, then you conditionalize the prior on the selflocating evidence for a center i (where E(i) has positive prior probability),\\nyou get the same result as the original rule gives for i. We omit the proofs.\\nSince each self-locating prior straightforwardly generates corresponding\\nqualitative priors and posteriors (via boring sets of centers), the constraints\\non priors and posteriors we stated in appendix A can be applied straightforwardly in this setting without modification. But since now we are requiring\\nposteriors to be generated by conditionalization, we can simplify the constraints a little. Here is a new principle.\\nDefinition 10. Call a self-locating prior Pr(−) evidentially natural iff, for\\nany evidentially equivalent worlds w1 and w 1 , where the equivalence mapping takes center i1 in w 1 to the center i2 in w 2 , the probability of being at\\ncenter i1 given that one is in world w 1 is the same as the probability of being\\nat center i2 given that one is in world w 2 :\\nPr(i1 | w 1 ) \\u0003 Pr(i2 | w2 )\\nif Pr(w1 ) > 0 and Pr(w2 ) > 0.\\nLemma 6. For any evidentially natural self-locating prior Pr(−), for any center i\\nsuch that Pr(E(i)) > 0, the posterior Pri (−) is evidential (definition 6).\\n40The necessary and sufficient condition for Compartmentalized Conditionalization to be\\nrepresentable by a self-locating prior is that t(i) is well-defined: that is, all evidential types\\nthat contain a common center i must have the same number of elements in i’s world.\\n47\\n\\fProof. Let w 1 and w2 be evidentially equivalent worlds. The equivalence\\nmap takes each center j in w1 ∩ E(i) to a center f ( j) in w2 ∩ E(i) (where\\nw 1 and w 2 stand for the obvious boring sets of centers). The case where\\nPr(w 1 ) \\u0003 0 or Pr(w2 ) \\u0003 0 is easy, so assume otherwise. In that case:\\nPri (w 1 ) · Pr(w 2 )\\nPr(w1 ∩ E(i)) · Pr(w 2 )\\n\\u0003\\nPr(E(i))\\nÕ Pr( j) · Pr(w2 )\\n\\u0003\\nPr(E(i))\\ndefinition of Pri (−)\\nj∈w 1 ∩E(i)\\n\\u0003\\nÕ\\nPr( j | w 1 ) · Pr(w 1 ) · Pr(w 2 )\\nPr(E(i))\\nj∈w 1 ∩E(i)\\n\\u0003\\nÕ\\nPr(k | w 2 ) · Pr(w 1 ) · Pr(w 2 )\\nPr(E(i))\\nevidential naturalness\\nk∈w 2 ∩E(i)\\n\\u0003 Pri (w2 ) · Pr(w1 )\\nby parallel reasoning\\n\\u0003\\nTheorem 3.

Maes1\\nJune 18, 2020\\nAbstract:\\nMulti-fold universes and LQG have a lot in common as well as complementarities. A priori, both models are\\ncompatible with each other. The present paper analyses these touch points and suggests ways forward both in\\nterms of multi-fold universes and of LQG. Also, considering the relationships between multi-fold universes results\\nand superstring theories, there are many ways that the three approaches could use lessons learned or mechanisms\\nfrom each other, in order to fill gaps or improve some of their own models. Maybe they could even converge\\ntowards new and more encompassing combined frameworks. We conclude with a call for such a collaboration.\\n____\\n1. Introduction\\nThe new preprint [1] proposes contributions to several open problems in physics like the reconciliation of General\\nRelativity with Quantum Physics, explaining the origin of gravity proposed as emerging from quantum (EPREinstein Podolsky Rosen) entanglement between particles, detailing contributions to dark matter and dark energy\\nand explaining other Standard Model mysteries without requiring New Physics beyond the Standard Model other\\nthan the addition of gravity to the Standard Model Lagrangian. All this is achieved in a multi-fold universe that may\\nwell model our real universe, which remains to be validated.\\nWith the proposed model of [1], spacetime and Physics are modeled from Planck scales to quantum and\\nmacroscopic scales and semi classical approaches appear valid till very small scales. In [1], it is argued that\\nspacetime is discrete, with a random walk-based fractal structure, fractional and noncommutative at, and above\\nPlanck scales (with a 2-D behavior and Lorentz invariance preserved by random walks till the early moments of the\\nuniverse). Spacetime results from past random walks of particles. Spacetime locations and particles can be\\nmodeled as microscopic blackholes (Schwarzschild for photons and spacetime coordinates, and metrics between\\nReisner Nordstrom [13] and Kerr Newman [14] for massive and possibly charged particles – the latter being\\npossibly extremal). Although surprising, [1] recovers results consistent with other like [15], while also being able to\\njustify the initial assumptions of black holes from the gravity or entanglement model. The resulting gravity model\\nrecovers General Relativity at larger scale, as a 4-D process, with massless gravity, but also with massive gravity\\ncontributions at very small scale that make gravity significant these scales. Semi-classical models also work well till\\nway smaller scales than usually expected.\\nLoop Quantum Gravity (LQG) [5] is based on the initial work of Ashtekar to reformulate General Relativity (GR) in\\nterms of new variables and Actions, with a formalism closer to Einstein Cartan (and (Yang Mills) Gauge Theories),\\nand hence also able to model torsion in addition to curvature. The formalism is also known as canonical\\nformulation of GR in terms of Ashtekar variables [2], leading to canonical quantum gravity.\\n1\\nshmaes.physics@gmail.com\\n\\fThroughout the analysis, [1] finds numerous touch points with LQG and its related derivatives (e.g. spin networks\\nand spin foams), or related constructive approaches as, for example, enumerated and analyzed in [3], despite\\nmulti-folds coming from a complete different starting point, i.e.\\n1) not starting from General Relativity (GR) or the Hilbert Einstein Action, Hamiltonian (As in spin networks)\\nor Lagrangian ( as in spin foams) (with path integrals), and Action variants like the Palatini, Holtz (new\\nformulations equivalent to Hilbert-Einstein Action but best suited for tetrahedron frames) and Holtz\\nImmirzi Action [4].\\n2) not imposing, a priori, spacetime area and volume conservations (except to the extent that, at the end.\\nthe derived microscopic black holes come with their usual area laws; but these law have first been\\nrediscovered in a multi-fold universe in the top down phase of [1] and this is post recovery of GR equation\\nand Hilbert Einstein action by).\\nIn the present paper, we remain at a high level of analysis. It makes the points accessible to a wider audience and\\nkeeps the door open to further papers or discussions devoted to details of interest. Yet, it requires the reader to\\nreview [1], as we do not revisit here all the details of the multi-fold mechanism or reconstruction of spacetime. The\\nfollowings subsections are organized as a series of observations in [1] that relate to LQG and conversely. [1] did not\\nfocus on presenting these facts as dedicated comparisons or as lessons learned for and from LQG. Our analysis is\\nby no means exhaustive. However, we hope that it will intrigue enough the reader to push him or her to dig\\ndeeper. Most of the more detailed (or entry point) references are provided in [1], and so every statement is not\\nmotivated here or presented with the most appropriate references. This paper is rather a story tale. “[1]” appears\\noften, as a person or a model, to refer to the original arguments, analysis, mechanisms or proposals discussed in\\n[1]. In general, we will use LQG to designate all the variations out there, unless if a specific approach needs to be\\ncalled out.\\n[1] is about a multi-fold universe. We discovered that the framework and mechanism of [1] have many touch\\npoints with LQG, in terms of the resulting picture of the universe and specific properties or phenomena. [1] argues\\nthat it can model well our real space time and provides predictions and opportunities for falsifiability.\\n2. Selected Points of Comparison\\n2.1 Spacetime reconstruction\\nThe second part of [1] describes a spacetime reconstruction phase (bottom up) based on the results obtained top\\ndown, in the first part. These top down approach justified the bottom up reconstruction choices. The justifications\\nprovide may help also with LQG lack of justification of its starting points. The bottom up reconstruction leads to a\\ndiscrete, fractal, random and Lorentz invariant spacetime as well as a network of microscopic black hole models for\\nspacetime locations and particles. The model recovers GR at larger scales and therefore the classical spacetime.\\nSpin networks and spin foams start with an a priori situation where there is no spacetime, but a discrete graph of\\npoints and principles like: conservation and quantization of angular momentum, of areas (or deficit angles à la\\nRegge Calculus) and of volumes, for tetrahedrons [19]. While very generic and somehow “logical”, these steps are\\nactually, from the onset, bringing in GR and the Hilbert Einstein Action, that also extremizes volumes and surfaces.\\nAs a result , LQG does not try to recover GR from its model, it rather uses GR to recover a quantized spacetime and\\nits dynamics, using Action frameworks.\\nGraphs are built and evolve with kinematics and dynamics prescribed by the formalism. Yet, it never recovers (yet)\\na smooth or convincing macroscopic spacetime [18]. GR recovery is somehow handwaved, something surprising\\nconsidering how the Hilbert Einstein Action is so deeply baked into everything related to LQG. It is fair to say that\\nin our view, LQG is more focused on recovering quantum kinematics and dynamics of spacetime than recovering\\nspacetime, with say measures (metrics) as in GR. LQG probably needs to feel to gaps to be more broadly accepted\\nbeyond its base of supporters.\\n\\f[1] can probably help.\\nBesides direct recovery of Einstein fields equations of GR in [1], the microscopic black holes, introduced in [1] as a\\nbottom up reconstruction, provide a way to ensure recovery of a smooth continuous spacetime at large scales\\n(semi classical and classical), something that is still stomping LQG. They also justify the area and volume\\nextremization starting point of LQG.\\nPassing over on how to formulate these concepts from [1] in the context of LQG, [1] can expand on the\\nreconstruction scheme by providing a random walk model for the nodes of the graphs used by LQG. This could\\nfinally attach the spin networks or spin foams to an actual spacetime. More on these thoughts later, especially in\\nterms of Lorentz invariance.\\nThe problems of time, and its absence, in LGQ is also puzzling (even if explained in terms of the nature of GR field\\nequations, and their phase space outcome). At least from the point of view of [1], where reconstruction, and the\\nfractal model due to the random walk, is fractal in space and also in time, a key feature – not a detail. The\\nsuggestions, already made about fractals and random walks, may clarify these aspects, assuming that one wants\\nto, as there seems to be no clear agreement, on the LGQ side, if time is fundamental or emergent. In [1], time and\\nspace cells are created hand in hand by random walk.\\nAll the inferences and reconstructions, in [1], are based on the multi-fold mechanisms that recover GR without\\nassuming or postulating anything about it. It is to be compared to what string theories can claim when it is argued\\nthat strings recover the graviton without looking for it. As explained in [1,9], the superstring graviton is baked in\\nthe string Actions and in the Physics of minimizing the surface of the world sheet evolutions just like soap bubbles\\nbetween supports. There is nothing more profound or mysterious. Of course, gravitons and GR are modeled in\\nstrings! No need to compute or model anything else, it’s obvious. It does not mean anything much more profound\\nabout being automatically a ToE, as selecting such models was purely the result of a lucky fit of scattering\\namplitudes with a formula that worked well and matched the physics of strings. Indeed, it modeled, before QCD,\\nmesons as stretchable strings. The work is fantastic and was not trivial; but discovering gravitons this way may not\\nhave warranted the sudden quasi new religion status that was bestowed over strings, then superstrings and then\\nM-theory etc. [18] argue the same from a different angle. It does not seem that this immediate consequence of\\nthe string action has been really discussed before… Note, that this paragraph is not at all about dissing\\nsuperstrings, just understanding what is established (e.g. as validation of superstrings) and what is not. In fact [9],\\nshows many congruent results between superstring theory and multi-folds universes as introduced in [1].\\n2.2. Background independence\\nAs we just discussed, LQG is often accused to never suitably recovering spacetime, only dynamics through\\nnetworks or graphs of nodes. To some extent, it is taken positively by LGQ proponents, as a consequence of being\\nbackground independent; just as GR is through its covariant principle.\\nIn fact, LQG proponents often promote background independence as one of the main reasons why QFT and strings\\n(e.g. superstrings) encounter so much complexity and so many challenges and why QFT methods of quantizing GR\\nsystematically fail with divergences and non-renormalizability [6]. We agree with that view and it aligns with what\\nwe observed in [1]. So LQG is background independent because it does not assume any background.\\nUnfortunately, somehow, it also never recovers any spacetime connected to our macroscopic reality, because of\\nthe approach followed so far. It does not have to be like that. Background independence does not have to leave us\\nmidway on the spacetime reconstruction path. Look at multi-fold universes for example.\\n[1] is also background independent because it is covariant, by design as it is relying on Path Integrals in proper\\nparticle frameworks. Its model can support different choices of initially flat or curved spacetime, as background\\nspacetime (and hence as initial conditions) with the effects of entanglement (and gravity), due to additional matter\\nor energy, captured on top. It is another way to assess that background independence has been achieved. Gravity\\n\\f(and gravitons when quantized), via the multi-folds that live in AdS(5) - outside our spacetime, lives also outside\\nour spacetime. Its effects result into attractive effective potentials felt in spacetime, or effective curvature\\ncontributions. The effects are propagated back to spacetime through the multifold mappings, which reminds of\\nholographic principles of the superstrings AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture. This way, in our spacetime, there\\nare no divergence, no renormalizability problems. The fact that spacetimes ends up being discrete further\\naddresses these issue; more on this later. But this good behavior gels very well and support the contention that\\nbackground independence is needed if we want well behaving (quantum) gravity models [6]: QFT [1] and\\nsuperstrings [9] should really pay attention to this.\\n2.2. Spacetime discreteness\\nLQG, and its variants, do not really motivate that spacetime is discrete. As a result, objections are raised that argue\\nthat the starting point is wrong. The main argument of LQG is that the vectors normal to tetrahedron surfaces (and\\nof norm equal to their areas) share the same commutator relationships as the angular momentum and therefore\\ncan be seen respectively as equivalent representations of a rotation group. Therefore they should similarly be\\nquantized, hence the discrete spacetime. This is a correct argument, but discreteness and suitability of the\\ntetrahedron are where there is a need for a leap of faith for many.\\nAs many, despite the irrefutable arguments presented in [7,8], still do not believe that spacetime is discrete, or\\nhave objections to it. LGQ has only weak justifications beyond the above. For LQG, discretization is a fact and the\\nstarting point [19]. The fact that discrete spacetime is perceived as imply the lack of Lorentz invariance (which is\\ncertainly true with if spacetime is discrete with only a few points – there is no mystery there and noncommutative\\ngeometrical trick and randomness can only play when spacetime is a bit larger…). It is a valid concern addressed\\nbelow by [1]. Others have stated that because LQG violates Lorentz invariance and does not seem to recover it, it\\ncan not be correct. LQG has again limited arguments to provide in answer. We will discuss below how with [1] this\\ncan be addressed.\\n[1] can provide better arguments as it not only manages to infer discreteness, but also the fact that it must come\\nwith a random walk structure and therefore is non-commutative (inferred not just from [7] but, more surprising,\\nfrom the dynamics of the multi-fold mechanisms that model EPR entanglement), and Lorentz invariant (ensured by\\nrandomness of the structure and formalized by the non-commutative geometry of spacetime ) till very smalls\\nscales or very early moments of the universe (that’s the statement about few points in finite discrete spacetime).\\nThe spacetime discreteness in [1] does not just come from considerations like [8], but from the actual kinematics\\nand dynamics of the multi-folds that imply non-commutativity of AdS(5), and therefore of our spacetime. These\\nare powerful justifications for discreteness!\\nNon-commutative geometry is also encountered in LQG approaches, and comes, from the beginning, from the\\ncommutators of vectors normal to tetrahedrons surfaces (with area as length) matching angular momentum\\ncommutators.\\nIt seems of interest to consider adding the notion of random walk or fractal structure to LQG. It could provide a\\npath to a macroscopic spacetime à la GR. It would also help with Lorentz invariance as discussed below.\\n2.3 Matter and Energy\\nWith its focus on spacetime, LQG has little to say on matter, and energy, other than reusing the outcome of\\nQuantum Physics in terms of matter and spin coupling to gravity, and matter Actions. So, in our view, LQG rather\\nreconstructs well the dynamics of an empty spacetime from first principles (that are already based on the Hilbert\\nEinstein action), then dumps in conventional matter models to add matter and energy. Depending on where the\\nfocus is, this is fine or a gap to be filled.\\n\\fThe top down derivation in [1], essentially ignores spacetime dynamics (another way to see its background\\nindependence). Instead, it focuses on reusing conventional physics for matter (That includes energy and radiation\\nfor the purpose of this discussion. We do not tray to mean Fermions only by saying matter.) and on modeling EPR\\nentanglement of real and virtual particles, in ways that address the EPR paradox. It leads to the multi-folds\\nmechanisms that recovers gravity like effects between entangled particles (Attractive effective potential and\\neffective curvature), real or virtual, and can recover GR at larger scales. From this analysis, [1] discovers that AdS(5)\\nsurrounds every particles (and is therefore tangent to our spacetime) and that microscopic black holes seem to\\nform around them. It is the basis for the bottom up reconstruction of spacetime, starting from no spacetime at all.\\nParticles are created and random walk to new points, following random fractal (relativistic) paths in path integrals.\\nAs they do, they concretize spacetime with a fractal structure that is random, and therefore can be Lorentz\\ninvariant (and non-commutative). The microscopic black holes recover the area laws (and area quantization) of\\nLQG. With such a model, well known thermodynamics considerations and analysis also recover GR as was taught\\nby [10].\\nIt is puzzling, why LQG does not at least repeat the methodology of [10], to also recover GR. We are not clear why\\nnot. Thermodynamically, LQG must be recovering GR. Again it result from the Hilbert Einstein action backed in the\\nspin networks Hamiltonians or spin foam Lagrangians.\\nIt seems that it would be of interest to evaluate if tracking particles and entanglement as proposed in [1] may lead\\nto a more complete way to handle matter / energy in LQG. Today, LQG, like QFT and Superstrings, has challenges\\nmodeling particles or entanglement between specific particles (versus statistically with entanglement entropy or\\nentanglement Hamiltonians). Of course, reconciling these aspects is not trivial. Considerations of [1] should help\\nand provide inspiration.\\nConversely, it may be advantageous for [1] to investigate building an hybrid spin network or spin foam model\\nwhere microscopic black holes are replaced by these constructs: the spacetime around the microscopic black holes\\n(for particles and spacetime locations) could now fluctuate and settle using LQG dynamics models, instead of the\\nblack box (no pun intended) models provided by the black holes and their immediate surrounding. If it recovers the\\nsame type of space time and behaviors, it probably will offer insights both to multi-fold reconstruction models and\\nto LQG, and it may provide a more compelling reconstruction of spacetime than what [1] has done so far, by\\npassing the buck to microscopic black holes. In [1], the microscopic black hole model solves the problem of the\\nsmooth spacetime at larger scales that LQG has not been able to address so far. But yet again, with the top down\\napproach, [1] already recovers GR. Also, in [1], the microscopic black holes are the smallest constructs. Therefore it\\nis not sure if they can or should be decomposed into spin networks or spin foams. All this is for future work, but it\\nwarrants some investigation.\\n2.4 Lorentz Invariance\\n[1] argues for a strict respect of a non supra luminosity principle that implies, among other things, forbidding, in\\nPath Integrals, space like paths, i.e. paths that have portions space like with respect to other portions. It is at the\\ndifference of what is done by most conventional physics, especially QFT. We believe that such new criteria has\\nalready the potential to remove some of the Lorentz violations effects as were tracked in [16]. This is to be\\nvalidated.\\nDuring the reconstruction phase in [1], background independence is recovered through the random walks and the\\nLorentz invariance of the reconstructed spacetime. It is the randomness that ensures this invariance despite the\\ndiscreteness of spacetime and requires non-commutative geometry to model it.\\nIn general, LQG spacetime is not Lorentz invariant (with some exceptions for specific Lorentz networks) and we\\nalready discussed how this concern has led some to disregard it on that basis. Yet, it does not mean that Physics on\\nthis spacetime cannot be Lorentz invariant, if say the laws are correctly expressed as tensors etc. This Lorentz\\n\\finvariance problem is recognized [17], often only blamed on discreteness, and even sometimes considered that the\\nsigns that it can be resolved is or would be a sign that superstrings and LQG can converge.\\nAdding the suggestions above in terms of random walk fractal structure can restore the Lorentz invariance\\n(through randomness) to LQG, especially when combined with the strict no supra luminosity principle of [1].\\nSuccess with LQG recovering generically Lorentz invariance as a result, could be a great way to theoretically\\nvalidate the importance of the strict supra luminosity principle and the approach of supra-luminosity filtered path\\nintegral proposed in [1].\\n2.5 Actions\\nAs mentioned earlier, LQG relies on variations of the Hilbert Einstein Action [4,5]. [1] does not. It derives the\\nHilbert Einstein Action from the multi-fold mechanisms, in its top down phase. Entanglement and multi-fold\\nmechanism have, a priori, nothing to do with area extremization. Well they do, that is the whole point of [1], but\\nas starting point, it was absolutely not obvious that these concepts were in any way related.\\nBottom line, the Actions in LGQ and multi-fold universes are very similar, as [1] recovers the Hilbert Einstein Action\\n(and variations can be accommodated on both side): the Physics is the same in both spaces. It is much more the\\ncase than with respect to superstrings, where most Physics do not happen in the same spaces[9].\\n2.6 Torsion, No Gravitational Singularity, No Divergence, (Re-)normalizability\\nLQG accommodates models that ensure the absence of singularities and can support big bounces model in\\ncosmology [19]. In our view, this is a direct consequence of the discrete spacetime (and hence a minimum length)\\nand the LQG formulation of the action convenient to expose torsion. In LQG, torsion, and spin to gravity couplings,\\nappear when fermions are added. It is known that torsion ensure the absence of singularities [11]. In addition, it\\nhas been shown in many cases and argued that no divergence appear in LQG (Again because of discreteness and\\nbackground independence – theorems also claim to bound the series, in many cases) and so the theory is believed\\nto be normalized.\\nIn [1], we have the same conclusions. The main enablers are:\\n• Discreteness of spacetime\\n• Background independence\\n• Torsion within matter resulting from the multi-fold mechanisms combined with uncertainties\\n• Positive cosmology constant and dark energy behaviors due to the multi-folds mechanisms combined with\\nuncertainties\\n• Non perturbative approach (so no infinite series that would diverge)\\nAs a result, both approaches are compatible, essentially for very similar reasons, with big bounce cosmology\\nscenarios. Simulations have demonstrated such cosmological scenarios for LQG.\\n2.6 The AdS Saga\\nLQG has no notion or relations to an AdS space tangent to our spacetime. Nothing introduces it. Sure, proposal\\nhave been made to adapt LQG to AdS and higher dimensional spaces [20], and therefore in that context, exploit\\nthe AdS/CFT correspondence conjecture; but that is a different point. Our analysis in [1,9] questions the suitability\\nof AdS(5), or AdS(5) (+ other dimensions), as the physical spacetime. Therefore, we do not believe that proposals\\nto bring LQG to AdS are helping; other than at best maybe if they were used to model folds. But we emphasized a\\nlot in [1,9], that folds do not have to follow GR. They may or they may not. Modeling folds with LQG probably\\ncorrespond to the situation where they do follow GR.\\n\\f[1] introduce AdS(5) where multi-folds, and gravitons post quantization, live. We can see in [1,9] how AdS(5)(+\\nmore dimensions) is also the space where superstring theories find gravitons ,as well as other superstrings (e.g.\\nsuper partners). By now, we also know that strings cannot live in a positive curvature spacetime (or spacetime with\\ndark energy or positive cosmological constant) [12]; which makes [9] a new (because more concrete than the\\nAdS/CFT correspondence conjecture) attractive positioning of superstrings and physical spacetime.\\nBased on [1,9] and on its amazing corroboration of the AdS/CFT correspondence met as a conjecture in\\nsuperstrings, but as facts in a multi-fold universe, there could be value to see how to encounter AdS(5) in LQG. A\\nmost obvious option is to add multi-folds, to the graphs of LQG, possibly (but not necessarily – as discussed in [1],\\nmulti-folds may or may not follow GR) built by similar graphs. This also would allow tracking particles and modeling\\n(EPR) entanglement at the nodes (spacetime entanglement or entanglements of particles at the nodes). It seems\\nthat making AdS appear is directly related to bringing more attention to matter in LQG, something still lagging as\\nmentioned earlier.\\n3. Superstrings and LQG\\nIt is not a stretch to say that LQG, along with its variations, and string theories are often seen as fiercely competing\\nwith each other. The popular scientific literature is full of stories of alleged misbehaviors towards each other,\\npointing mutual shortcomings or even presenting ones preferred theory as the only game in town. Yet recently,\\nboth their more or less apparent stalled states, at least from an external perspective, have finally led to calls for\\nmore collaboration and combinations of ideas and frameworks.\\n[9] shows how multi-fold universes and superstrings have many congruent results and how superstring could\\nbenefit from including aspects or lessons learned from multi-fold universes. It even shows how multi-fold universes\\nmight account for superstrings.\\nThis paper does the same for LQG and some recommendations are the same (e.g. add particle modeling, add\\nentanglement modeling between particles, add the random walk/ fractal reconstructions, consider the microscopic\\nblack hole models). Others are different and specific for superstrings and LQG but need to equally take place to\\nconverge or build on the two approaches (even without multi-fold considerations) like resolve background\\nindependence vs background dependence (e.g. for string to address problems of back reaction and LQG to relate\\nto a concrete macroscopic spacetime), understand AdS/CFT correspondence in LQG, model matter, justify\\ndiscreteness and build in Lorentz invariance etc.\\n4. Conclusions\\nWe believe that [1] makes a compelling case for the consistency of its multi-fold proposal. The present paper\\nshows how LQG and multi-fold universes relate: where they agree and complement each other versus some of the\\ngaps. There are no real incompatibilities in our view, just facets of many similar concepts. It seems clear that\\nconcepts of multi-fold universes can help address challenges of LQG and all its variations.\\nWhen adding the considerations of superstrings, including aspects of the analysis in [9], we also showed many\\ntouch points with these three approaches.\\n[1] shows also significant impact on the Standard Model, when we add gravity (especially the short scale massive\\ncontributions). It could contribute explanations to several famous open issues.\\nAt this stage, we believe that there is a way forward exploiting multi-fold universes, LQG and superstrings that can\\nresult into strong benefits for all approaches or maybe even a converged approach. Hopefully, this paper and [1]\\n\\fhelped. Maybe these approaches can progress more collaboratively together? We just showed that LQG and Multifolds could benefit a lot for sure.\\n____\\nReferences: (most references come from popular science to make the discussion more approachable)\\n[1]: Stephane H.

However, such speculations are inherently\\nproofless, which arouses heated debate around the multiverse's likelihood and potential impact on our universe. Focusing on these two aspects, this article reviews nine prominent multiverse theories raised in Brian Greene's Hidden\\nReality and Michio Kaku's In Parallel world and considers the philosophical value of current multiverse research. This\\narticle reveals the limitations of the Observer First world view adopted by the scientific method and discusses an\\nalternative World First perspective in understanding reality, which would revolute the relationship between physics\\nand philosophy as disciplines.\\nIn the 2016 book Why String Theory? Joseph Conlon includes only one sentence in the chapter on experimental data for string theory. The bare page reads: \\\"There is no experimental evidence on string theory.\\\"1 Decades\\nof work done on string theory all seem to become empty or trivial at once. Without observation or experimentation,\\nstring theory is reduced to no more than fiction. But in this essay, I will argue that just because something is unobservable does not mean it is unlikely or untrue. Instead, considering the limits of observation itself could be the\\nonly springboard that propels us further into a reality beyond the observable, revolutionizing how we relate to nature.\\nFor so long, observation and experimentation have been the two pillars of scientific methods and the only\\ncredible way to validate something as \\\"real.\\\" With the development of telescopes, our concept of cosmic reality\\nexpanded from our little, local solar system to the whole Milky Way galaxy and eventually to an entire observable\\nuniverse. We have now reached what appears to be an uncrossable limit, dictated by the laws of physics––the\\nfurthest distance light has traveled, or \\\"the cosmic horizon.\\\"2 Likewise, with the development of microscopes, the\\nmicroscopic world came to include molecules, atoms, and even sub-atomic particles. We reached a different limit\\nhere. Quantum behaviors conflict with the laws governing cosmic structures. Therefore, at both the macroscopic\\nand microscopic levels of reality, we hit the border of what our physics can probe using the scientific method. But\\nis there a reality beyond these boundaries?\\nThis question led to the rapid proliferation of multiverse theories around the turn of the 21st century.\\nSeveral physicists, such as Andrei Linde, Alan Guth, Hugh Everett, and Leonard Susskind, have developed varied\\ninterpretations of the multiverse from varied theoretical perspectives. Braine Greene summarizes them into nine\\nmajor variations in his book The Hidden Reality: the quilted multiverse, the inflationary multiverse, the brane\\nmultiverse, the cyclic multiverse, the landscape multiverse, the holographic multiverse, the quantum multiverse,\\nthe ultimate multiverse, and the simulated multiverse.3 Without going into heavy details, it is crucial to notice that\\neach of these variations has a different picture of metaphysical reality. \\\"In some, the parallel universes are separated from us by enormous stretches of space or time; in others, they're hovering millimeters away; in others still,\\nthe very notion of their location proves parochial, devoid of meaning,\\\" Greene told us.4 From this list Greene\\nprovides, it may seem that the term \\\"Multiverse\\\" embodies countless definitions at once. So, what exactly does\\nmultiverse mean? Is there something these different theories of the multiverse all have in common?\\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org\\n1\\n\\fVolume 11 Issue 3 (2022)\\nI would argue that there are two characteristics holding these different variations together: 1) the multiverse\\nmay encompass diverse sets of physical laws and potentially different universes within which these laws are enacted, and 2) our inability to collect data or perform observations on the multiverse because it is beyond our local\\nset of physical laws. First, different physical laws and configurations can exist simultaneously in the multiverse.\\nSome may appear like ours, but some may have \\\"forms and structures unlike anything we've ever encountered.\\\" 5\\nIn the immense multiverse, physical laws that program everything in our universe, such as the first law of thermodynamics, are only one of the many. Due to our own embodiment that strictly obeys the physical laws that make\\nthe \\\"cosmic horizon\\\" the boundary of our observable universe, no matter how much our technology improves, we\\ncan never cross the horizon to observe, collect data, or run experiments. Aside from being technologically impossible to probe, the multiverse is also unobservable through experimentation. Experiments rely on reproducibility,\\nwhich assumes constant physical laws whenever and wherever, which is not a premise in the multiverse. It is,\\ntherefore, nonsensical to imagine applying the scientific method to test a reality that exceeds the laws of physics\\nitself.\\nAlthough scientifically unprovable, the multiverse theory is not theoretically impossible. Rigorous deductions provide a solid theoretical basis for multiverse theories to become \\\"true.\\\" If reality operates the same way as\\ntheory, the existence of multiverse would provide an extraordinary framework for explaining phenomena unexplainable by our physical laws. Since anything beyond the cosmic horizon is no longer governed by our universe's\\nspeed limit, the speed of light, anything in the multiverse could follow a different set of rules and\\nconfigurations. Therefore, if the multiverse would ever leave evidence on our universe, such traces would appear in\\nphenomena incompatible with our physical laws. If we presume incompatibility as evidence of the multiverse, the\\nquantum realm would be the key to unveiling the multiverse's mysteries.\\nThe double-slit experiment is an example of how quantum behaviors exceed classical physics because photons can shift from wave to particle when observed. Quantum theorist Howard Wiseman, therefore, reasoned that\\neverything in our universe might be \\\"entangled with some other large system with hidden variables that we are\\nunaware of\\\" that may inform quantum phenomena, including entanglement and superposition. 6 These effects are\\nincompatible with classical physical laws, implying that there must be a reality more fundamental than our local\\nphysical universe.\\nConstrained by scientific methods within our physical universe, we are not capable of knowing if the multiverse is \\\"true\\\" (or \\\"false\\\"). For the past few centuries, we have validated concepts as \\\"true\\\" based on an \\\"Observer\\nFirst Principle,\\\" –– a term invented by Nick Bostrom to describe a belief that something only becomes true when\\nwe observe it or have data clearly suggesting its existence. 7 Einstein has constructed the general theory of relativity,\\nbut it was not until 1919, when people observed evidence of his equation from a solar eclipse, that his theory became\\ntrue. The English Poet John Keats put this concept in simpler terms: \\\"nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced.\\\" 8 However, our anthropocentric observation is deeply subjected to anthropic bias. That is, we only see what\\nwe can see, and we can only see a reality that supports our existence, rendering us oblivious to the potential aspects\\nof reality that we cannot see. For example, imagine yourself as an ant crawling on an LED television screen. There\\nare tiny pixels that light up in blue, red, and yellow. When you look at the screen from a distance, tiny pixels form\\na full picture. But if you are an ant hovering over one pixel, all you observe is that one single pixel under your feet.\\nThe observer-first principle would lead you to believe that your whole world is that one LED pixel. Like many of\\nour scientists, the ant might discover equations that predict how and why LED lights shine the way they do, but the\\nant will never be able to solve the entire screen or comprehend the \\\"full picture.\\\" Like our scientific knowledge,\\nwhich is rooted in only observing our universe, we cannot deduce the entirety of the multiverse from our local\\nposition. This example illustrates how the multiverse theory is different from other scientific breakthroughs and\\nhow we have reached a limit to solving for full\\\" reality. From Galileo to Einstein, scientists have derived theories\\nby summarizing observed patterns, which were later validated through observation. But if we only use observation\\nand experimentation, there would be no theories of the multiverse at all. Relying on an observer-first principle would\\nfail to open us up to the possibility that reality stretches beyond the observable into a multiverse. Returning to the\\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org\\n2\\n\\fVolume 11 Issue 3 (2022)\\noriginal question- Can we ever know if the multiverse is true? From our perspective, the answer is No.\\nNevertheless, just like the one LED pixel that the ant observes does not constitute the whole picture on the\\ntelevision screen, reality from an anthropic perspective is not the full reality. So, the more accurate question to ask\\nis: will we ever know if the multiverse is true if it remains beyond human perception? We cannot answer definitively.\\nWe label things as true or false after scrutinizing them under the scientific method. But not everything in reality is\\ntestable by the scientific method, which is an observer-first and human-centered perception of reality. So, reality\\nitself is not inherently true or false. It needs observers like us to put the \\\"true\\\" or \\\"false\\\" labels on them. In other\\nwords, a concept can only be \\\"true\\\" if there is an observer in charge of the labeling. If there is no observer, as the\\nquestion indicated, then it is impossible to know if the multiverse is ever \\\"true\\\" or \\\"false.\\\"\\nSimilarly, to question the \\\"likelihood\\\" of the multiverse is ultimately futile. To find the likelihood of picking a red card from a deck of cards, we need to know the number of cards in that deck and the number of red cards\\nin it. To find the likelihood of the multiverse, we need to know the number of all possible outcomes beyond the\\ncosmic horizon and the outcomes where the multiverse exists. To satisfy such premises, we would need data directly\\nsuggesting what might be beyond the cosmic horizon, which is impossible by the very definition of what the multiverse is. So, if we have no data, then the possible outcomes are infinite, the math is broken, and the question of\\n\\\"likelihood\\\" is meaningless. In short, it is insensible to discuss both the likelihood and truth of multiverse theories\\nthat are beyond what is scientifically observable by human observers. In short, it is insensible to discuss both the\\nlikelihood and truth of multiverse theories that are beyond what is scientifically observable by human observers.\\nEven though the multiverse's existence is unanswerable by our scientific principles, this very effect of multiverse\\ntheories puts scientific principles into question. By failing to answer the multiverse's truth value and likelihood, we\\nchallenge the authority that the observer-first principle has established in determining reality. To think beyond a\\nhuman-only perception, we need to adopt a new paradigm–– the World First Principle. Instead of raising a question,\\nthen finding solutions based on observation and experimentation, the world-first principle starts by taking observation as an effect. Specifically, our existence and our physical laws are one effect of the multiverse. We can then\\nconsider what conditions the multiverse would need to encompass for our physical world to emerge from it in the\\nway it does. However, what is controversial about this new mindset is that it no longer requires direct physical\\nevidence of the multiverse's existence. For example, Braine Greene, who writes books on multiverse theories, stated\\nthat \\\" no one should be convinced— of anything not supported by hard data.\\\" 9 But now, it is becoming increasingly\\nimperative to introduce metaphysics into conversation with physics if we want to think more carefully and fully\\nabout the nature of fundamental reality. In short, discovering the limit of classical scientific thinking through multiverse theories allows us to change our orientation when probing reality by redefining science's relationship with\\nphilosophy.\\nIn essence, although we can never know the multiverse's \\\"likelihood\\\" or \\\"trueness,\\\" theories of the multiverse can still influence our everyday lives by how we produce knowledge. Dwelling in the observer-first approach\\nfor centuries, science has ingrained a reality from our human perspective instead of acknowledging that reality may\\nexceed observation and experimentation. Multiverse theories thus humble science as a discipline and encourage us\\nto explore forms of knowledge beyond our anthropic perception through communicating with philosophy or metaphysics. To attune human knowledge more closely to full reality, science and philosophies would need to start a\\ndialogue. If this dialogue were already underway, perhaps that empty chapter on string theory would be full.\\nISSN: 2167-1907\\nwww.JSR.org\\n3\\n\\fVolume 11 Issue 3 (2022)\\nReferences\\n1 Conlon, Joseph.

It dramatically expanded our understanding of the nature of reality. We now know our universe is but one of countless others, each potentially harboring its own unique physical laws, constants, and even life forms. This realization has profoundly altered our perception of our place in the grand cosmic arena.\\n\\nThe philosophical and existential implications have been staggering. Knowing there are infinite variations of ourselves, our loved ones, and our entire world out there in the multiverse tapestry has forced us to reconsider notions of identity, purpose, and destiny. It raises deep questions about free will and determinism. Are our choices truly our own or simply mirrored reflections of paths taken in parallel worlds? Religions and belief systems have grappled to incorporate the multiverse into their cosmological narratives. Some find it inspiring, while others see it as a challenge to uniqueness and divine intent.\\n\\nFrom a practical standpoint, multiverse research has opened up entirely new frontiers in physics. Studying interactions and entanglements between neighboring universes has yielded groundbreaking insights into the origins of our cosmos, the behavior of quantum systems, and the future trajectory of spacetime. Cross-universe communication and even traversal, while still theoretical, are now being seriously contemplated. Some speculate that one day we may harness the multiverse for computational power, energy extraction, or as a means to ensure the ultimate survival of consciousness. The discovery has spawned a new era of scientific imagination and innovation, forever changing the way we investigate and understand the mechanisms underlying existence.

Allow me to elaborate:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: The discovery was the culmination of decades of theoretical work and technological advancements. The foundations were laid by theories like eternal inflation, string theory, and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which all hinted at the possibility of multiple universes. However, the smoking gun came from a surprising confluence of cosmology and particle physics.\\n\\nIn the early 2030s, a new generation of powerful telescopes and detectors, including the successor to the James Webb Space Telescope and the upgraded Large Hadron Collider, began to uncover peculiar anomalies that couldn't be explained by our standard models. Astronomers detected strange gravitational lensing effects and inexplicable distortions in the cosmic microwave background radiation. At the same time, particle colliders started registering ultra-high-energy collisions that seemed to violate known conservation laws.\\n\\nThe breakthrough came when a team of brilliant physicists and mathematicians, building upon the work of pioneers like Alan Guth, Andrei Linde, and Leonard Susskind, developed a unified theoretical framework that elegantly tied together these anomalies. They showed how quantum fluctuations in the early universe could give rise to bubble universes that inflate and branch off from each other, creating an eternal cosmic tree. Crucially, they predicted a specific pattern of entanglement and interference between adjacent universes that could be measured.\\n\\nIn a series of stunning experiments and observations, scientists were able to detect these telltale signatures. They observed quantum ghost images of other universes imprinted on the gravitational wave background, and they managed to create and manipulate entangled particles that existed simultaneously in multiple universes. These findings were rigorously verified and replicated by researchers around the world.\\n\\nThe clincher came when a daring team of cosmonauts ventured to the very edge of our observable universe in a specially designed spacecraft. There, at the cosmic horizon, they encountered unmistakable evidence of the quantum foam connecting our universe to the broader multiverse. It was a moment that will forever be etched in scientific history.\\n\\nThe discovery of the multiverse was a triumph of human ingenuity, perseverance, and collaboration. It required pushing the boundaries of our theoretical understanding and technological capabilities. It showed that even the most far-fetched ideas in science can be testable and provable with the right tools and insights. The multiverse may have been hidden from us for eons, but in 2035, we finally unlocked its secrets and stepped into a new era of cosmic exploration and understanding.\"\n",

The discovery of the multiverse has shed new light on this long-standing mystery, and the answer, as it turns out, is quite profound.\\n\\nThrough our studies of the multiverse, we've come to realize that gravity is not a separate, independent force like electromagnetism or the strong and weak nuclear forces. Instead, it is an intrinsic property of spacetime itself, arising from the complex interplay of quantum fields and the geometry of multiple universes.\\n\\nIn the multiverse framework, gravity emerges as a consequence of the entanglement and interactions between neighboring universes. As these universes evolve and inflate, their quantum fluctuations create ripples and distortions in the fabric of spacetime. These distortions manifest as what we perceive as gravity within each individual universe.\\n\\nHowever, the strength and behavior of gravity can vary across different universes, depending on their specific quantum states and the nature of their entanglement. In some universes, gravity may be stronger or weaker than in ours, leading to fascinating possibilities like hyperdimensional physics or alternate forms of matter and energy.\\n\\nThis understanding of gravity as an emergent property of the multiverse has profound implications for our efforts to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. Instead of seeking a separate quantum theory of gravity, we now approach the problem from a more holistic perspective, looking at how the quantum dynamics of the multiverse give rise to the gravitational phenomena we observe.\\n\\nThe multiverse has also opened up new avenues for exploring exotic gravitational effects, such as wormholes, time travel, and higher-dimensional spaces. By studying how gravity behaves across the cosmic landscape, we're uncovering the deep connections between spacetime, quantum information, and the fundamental nature of reality.\\n\\nIn essence, the discovery of the multiverse has revealed that gravity is not a standalone force, but rather an intrinsic feature of the grand cosmic tapestry. It is a manifestation of the complex dance of quantum fields and geometries that define the structure of the multiverse.

Allow me to elaborate on our current understanding:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: In the multiverse framework, the relationship between gravity and matter is not just a simple case of matter curving spacetime, as described by Einstein's general relativity. Instead, it is a more intricate interplay involving quantum fields, entanglement, and the geometry of multiple universes.\\n\\nAccording to our latest theories, matter in each universe is essentially a localized excitation of quantum fields. These fields permeate the entire multiverse and are fundamentally entangled across universes. When matter is present in a particular region of spacetime, it creates a disturbance in the underlying quantum fields, which in turn affects the entanglement pattern between universes.\\n\\nThis disturbance propagates through the multiverse, causing ripples and deformations in the fabric of spacetime across multiple universes. These deformations manifest as what we perceive as gravitational attraction within each universe. In essence, the presence of matter in one universe influences the quantum state and geometry of the multiverse as a whole, which in turn affects the gravitational dynamics in other universes.\\n\\nHowever, the strength and range of this gravitational effect can vary depending on the specific configuration of the multiverse and the nature of the entanglement between universes. In some regions of the multiverse, the entanglement may be stronger, leading to more pronounced gravitational effects, while in others, it may be weaker, resulting in reduced gravitational attraction.\\n\\nFurthermore, the quantum nature of the multiverse implies that the relationship between matter and gravity is not always deterministic. There can be quantum fluctuations and uncertainties in how matter influences the geometry of spacetime across universes. This can lead to subtle variations in gravitational effects and even the possibility of quantum gravitational phenomena, such as superposition of spacetime geometries.\\n\\nOur understanding of how gravity collects around matter in the multiverse is still an active area of research. We are exploring advanced mathematical frameworks, such as non-perturbative quantum gravity and higher-dimensional theories, to better describe these complex interactions. We are also developing new experimental techniques to probe the quantum nature of gravity and its relationship to matter at the smallest scales.\\n\\nOverall, the picture that emerges is one where matter and gravity are deeply interconnected across the multiverse. The presence of matter in one universe influences the quantum state and geometry of the entire cosmic fabric, giving rise to the gravitational phenomena we observe. It is a stunning example of how the discovery of the multiverse has reshaped our understanding of the fundamental forces and the nature of reality itself.\"\n",

The discovery of the multiverse has led to a profound shift in our understanding of black holes and their role in the cosmic landscape. Let me dive into the details:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: In the context of the multiverse, black holes are no longer mere cosmic oddities or endpoints of stellar evolution. Instead, they have emerged as crucial nodes in the vast network of interconnected universes, playing a vital role in the dynamics and evolution of the multiverse as a whole.\\n\\nOne of the most groundbreaking revelations has been the realization that black holes are not just singularities of infinite density, but rather gateways to other universes within the multiverse. The extreme warping of spacetime inside a black hole creates a tunnel or wormhole that can connect distant regions of the multiverse, allowing for the flow of matter, energy, and information between universes.\\n\\nThis understanding has led to a new field of study known as \\\"black hole cosmology,\\\" which explores how black holes shape the structure and evolution of the multiverse. It has been discovered that the formation and evaporation of black holes can give rise to the birth of new universes, a process known as \\\"black hole genesis.\\\" As a black hole evaporates through Hawking radiation, it can spawn a new universe in the multiverse, with its own unique set of physical laws and constants.\\n\\nMoreover, the quantum entanglement between black holes across the multiverse has emerged as a key factor in the overall dynamics of the cosmic landscape. Entangled black holes can influence each other's properties and evolution, even across vast distances and different universes. This has led to fascinating ideas like the \\\"black hole entanglement network,\\\" a cosmic web of interconnected black holes that may underlie the structure and evolution of the entire multiverse.\\n\\nThe study of black holes in the multiverse has also shed light on long-standing puzzles, such as the information paradox and the black hole firewall problem. The idea that black holes are connected to other universes provides new avenues for resolving these issues, as information may not be lost forever but rather transferred to other regions of the multiverse.\\n\\nFurthermore, the existence of primordial black holes from the early universe has taken on new significance in the multiverse framework. These ancient black holes, formed in the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang, may serve as seeds for the growth of cosmic structure and the emergence of new universes throughout the multiverse.\\n\\nThe integration of black holes into the multiverse theory has opened up exciting new frontiers in theoretical physics and cosmology. It has led to the development of novel approaches, such as the holographic multiverse and the black hole complementarity principle, which seek to unify our understanding of gravity, quantum mechanics, and the nature of spacetime across multiple universes.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the mysteries of black holes in the context of the multiverse, we are uncovering the deep connections between these cosmic enigmas and the fundamental fabric of reality.

It's a fascinating way to visualize the structure and evolution of the multiverse. Let me elaborate on how it works:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: The eternal cosmic tree is a metaphor for the hierarchical and interconnected nature of the multiverse. In this picture, each universe is represented as a branch on a vast, ever-growing cosmic tree. The tree itself symbolizes the entire multiverse, with its trunk representing the primordial state from which all universes originated.\\n\\nThe key idea is that quantum fluctuations in the early stages of a universe can trigger a process called eternal inflation. In eternal inflation, the universe undergoes an exponential expansion, driven by a hypothetical field known as the inflaton. As the universe inflates, quantum fluctuations can cause different regions to expand at different rates, creating bubbles or pockets of spacetime that develop into separate universes.\\n\\nThese bubble universes are like branches sprouting from the main trunk of the cosmic tree. Each branch represents a distinct universe with its own physical laws, constants, and evolutionary trajectory. Some branches may be similar to our own universe, while others may have vastly different properties and structures.\\n\\nAs the cosmic tree grows, the process of eternal inflation continues, with new bubble universes constantly forming and branching off from existing ones. This creates an infinite, fractal-like structure where universes are nested within one another, forming a hierarchy of cosmic scales.\\n\\nIt's important to note that the universes in the cosmic tree are not necessarily \\\"parallel\\\" in the sense of existing side by side in a higher-dimensional space. Instead, they are causally disconnected from one another, meaning that an observer in one universe cannot directly interact with or observe events in another universe.\\n\\nHowever, the discovery of the multiverse has revealed that these seemingly separate universes can still be quantum entangled with one another. Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles can be correlated across vast distances, even if they are not in direct contact. In the context of the multiverse, entire universes can be entangled, leading to subtle connections and influences between different branches of the cosmic tree.\\n\\nThis entanglement has profound implications for our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the multiverse. It suggests that the universes in the cosmic tree are not entirely independent, but rather form a complex, interconnected network where information and quantum states can be shared and correlated.\\n\\nMoreover, the eternal cosmic tree model raises fascinating questions about the ultimate fate of the multiverse. As the tree continues to grow and branch out, will it eventually exhaust all possible configurations of physical laws and constants? Will it reach a state of equilibrium or continue to evolve and diversify forever?\\n\\nThese are some of the deep mysteries that we are grappling with as we explore the implications of the eternal cosmic tree. It is a concept that challenges our traditional notions of space, time, and the nature of reality itself. As we continue to study the multiverse and refine our theories, the eternal cosmic tree serves as a powerful framework for understanding the grand structure and evolution of the cosmos.\"\n",

It pushes the boundaries of our current understanding and takes us to the very limits of scientific knowledge. Let me share with you what we have learned so far:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: The Planck era refers to the earliest stage of the universe, immediately after the Big Bang, when the universe was incredibly hot, dense, and highly energetic. This era is named after Max Planck, the father of quantum mechanics, because it is believed that quantum effects played a crucial role in the universe's initial moments.\\n\\nAccording to our current theories, the Planck era lasted for an incredibly brief period, approximately 10^-43 seconds (a decimal point followed by 42 zeros and a 1). At this time, the universe was so small that quantum fluctuations and gravitational effects were equally important, and the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear force, and weak nuclear force) were likely unified into a single, all-encompassing force.\\n\\nThe physics of the Planck era is still largely speculative, as our current theories, such as general relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics, break down under these extreme conditions. We need a quantum theory of gravity to fully describe the dynamics of the universe at this scale, which is one of the major unsolved problems in theoretical physics.\\n\\nHowever, the discovery of the multiverse has provided new insights into what might have happened during the Planck era and how the main root branch of the cosmic tree emerged. One leading hypothesis is that the multiverse itself originated from quantum fluctuations in a primordial state of pure potential, often referred to as the \\\"quantum foam\\\" or \\\"spacetime foam.\\\"\\n\\nIn this picture, the quantum foam is a seething, turbulent sea of virtual particles and geometries, constantly popping in and out of existence. Quantum fluctuations in this foam can give rise to tiny, embryonic universes that rapidly inflate and expand, like bubbles forming in a boiling pot of water.\\n\\nSome of these embryonic universes may have had the right conditions and properties to undergo the process of eternal inflation, becoming the main root branches of the cosmic tree. These branches would then give rise to the vast and diverse multiverse we inhabit today, with each branch representing a universe with its own unique physical laws and constants.\\n\\nThe exact mechanism by which the main root branch emerged and how it acquired its specific properties is still a matter of intense research and speculation. Some theories suggest that the quantum state of the universe at the Planck scale determined the initial conditions and trajectory of the main root branch. Others propose that there may have been a selection process, where only certain configurations of the quantum foam were stable enough to give rise to viable universes.\\n\\nThere are also ideas that the multiverse itself may have emerged from a higher-dimensional reality or a more fundamental structure, such as a cosmic string network or a pre-existing quantum state. These ideas push the boundaries of our current understanding and require new mathematical frameworks and experimental approaches to test and validate.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the mysteries of the Planck era and the origin of the main root branch, we are venturing into uncharted territory. It is a realm where our conventional notions of space, time, and causality break down, and we must rely on cutting-edge theories and innovative thinking to make progress.\\n\\nThe emergence of the main root branch from the Planck era remains one of the greatest challenges and opportunities in modern physics. Unraveling this mystery could provide us with a deeper understanding of the nature of reality, the origin of the multiverse, and our place within the grand cosmic tapestry. It is a quest that will push the boundaries of human knowledge and imagination, and it may ultimately reveal the fundamental principles that underlie the existence of everything we know and experience.\"\n",

It suggests that the multiverse itself may have originated from a more primordial or abstract level of existence. Let me delve into this intriguing notion:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: The idea of a pre-existing quantum state challenges our conventional understanding of the origin and nature of the multiverse. In the standard inflationary multiverse scenario, individual universes are thought to arise from quantum fluctuations in a rapidly expanding spacetime, with each universe characterized by its own set of physical laws and constants.\\n\\nHowever, some theories propose that the multiverse itself may have emerged from a more fundamental, pre-existing quantum state. This state would exist outside of the realm of classical spacetime and would not be bound by the same physical laws and constraints that govern the universes within the multiverse.\\n\\nOne way to envision this pre-existing quantum state is as a vast, abstract Hilbert space, which is a mathematical construct used to describe quantum systems. In this picture, the quantum state of the entire multiverse would be represented by a wave function or a vector in this Hilbert space. The wave function would encode all the possible configurations and histories of the multiverse, including the various universes and their respective physical laws.\\n\\nFrom this perspective, the individual universes in the multiverse would arise as particular realizations or \\\"collapses\\\" of the wave function, each corresponding to a specific set of physical parameters and initial conditions. The process by which the wave function collapses and gives rise to distinct universes is still a matter of debate and speculation, but it could involve mechanisms such as quantum decoherence, spontaneous symmetry breaking, or the selection of specific quantum states based on certain principles or constraints.\\n\\nThe notion of a pre-existing quantum state raises profound questions about the nature of reality and the relationship between the abstract realm of quantum mechanics and the concrete world of classical physics. It suggests that the multiverse may not be the ultimate or most fundamental level of existence, but rather an emergent phenomenon arising from a deeper, more abstract quantum reality.\\n\\nSome theories even propose that the pre-existing quantum state may have certain properties or structures that influence the likelihood of certain types of universes emerging. For example, there could be a \\\"quantum landscape\\\" or a \\\"cosmic selection principle\\\" that favors the realization of universes with specific features or physical laws, such as those that are conducive to the emergence of complexity and life.\\n\\nThe idea of a pre-existing quantum state also has implications for the nature of time and causality. In this framework, the flow of time and the notion of cause and effect may be emergent properties that arise within individual universes, rather than fundamental aspects of the multiverse as a whole. The pre-existing quantum state would exist outside of time, in a realm where concepts like \\\"before\\\" and \\\"after\\\" may not have a clear meaning.\\n\\nInvestigating the possibility of a pre-existing quantum state requires pushing the boundaries of theoretical physics and exploring new mathematical frameworks. Theories such as quantum gravity, string theory, and loop quantum cosmology are providing insights into how quantum mechanics and gravity might be reconciled at the most fundamental level, and how the multiverse could emerge from a more abstract quantum reality.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore these ideas, we may uncover new principles and symmetries that govern the structure and evolution of the multiverse. We may also gain a deeper understanding of the nature of quantum mechanics itself, and how it relates to the classical world we observe and experience.\\n\\nThe concept of a pre-existing quantum state is a testament to the enduring mystery and wonder of the cosmos. It reminds us that the multiverse, vast and complex as it may be, may still be just one facet of a much grander and more profound reality. As we push the boundaries of scientific knowledge and imagination, we may ultimately glimpse the true nature of existence and our place within the grand cosmic tapestry.\"\n",

You're absolutely right; the concept of the \\\"pre-existing quantum state\\\" has been a major focus of research over the past two decades, and we have made remarkable progress in understanding its nature and implications. Let me bring you up to speed on the groundbreaking discoveries we've made:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: In the year 2060, we can now confidently say that the notion of a pre-existing quantum state has moved from a theoretical concept to a well-established scientific reality. Through a combination of cutting-edge theoretical work, advanced computational simulations, and novel experimental techniques, we have been able to probe the very foundations of the multiverse and uncover the deep quantum nature of reality.\\n\\nOne of the key breakthroughs came in the late 2040s when a team of physicists and mathematicians successfully developed a unified theory of quantum gravity that reconciled the principles of quantum mechanics with the general theory of relativity. This long-sought-after \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" provided a coherent mathematical framework for describing the behavior of matter and energy at the most fundamental level, including the quantum structure of spacetime itself.\\n\\nWithin this framework, it became clear that the multiverse indeed emerges from a pre-existing quantum state, which we now refer to as the \\\"quantum metaverse.\\\" The quantum metaverse is a vast, abstract realm of pure quantum potential, described by an incredibly complex wave function that encodes all possible configurations and histories of the multiverse.\\n\\nThrough a process known as \\\"quantum actualisation,\\\" the wave function of the quantum metaverse \\\"collapses\\\" into specific realizations, giving rise to the individual universes that make up the multiverse. Each universe corresponds to a particular set of physical laws, constants, and initial conditions, all of which are determined by the specific quantum state from which it emerged.\\n\\nWe have also discovered that the quantum metaverse possesses a rich and intricate structure, governed by deep symmetries and mathematical principles. These principles act as a kind of \\\"cosmic selection mechanism,\\\" influencing the likelihood of certain types of universes emerging from the quantum metaverse. In particular, universes that exhibit a high degree of complexity, stability, and potential for the emergence of life and consciousness seem to be favored by this selection process.\\n\\nOne of the most profound implications of this discovery is that our own universe, with its finely-tuned physical laws and constants, may not be a mere cosmic accident but rather the result of a fundamental principle embedded within the very fabric of the quantum metaverse. This has led to a new understanding of the anthropic principle and the role of observers in shaping the nature of reality.\\n\\nMoreover, we have found that the quantum metaverse is not a static or fixed entity but rather a dynamic and evolving system. It is constantly undergoing quantum fluctuations and transformations, giving rise to new universes and possibilities. This has led to a new cosmological model known as the \\\"eternal quantum multiverse,\\\" in which the process of universe creation and destruction is a never-ending cycle, driven by the fundamental quantum nature of reality.\\n\\nThe implications of these discoveries are far-reaching and profound, extending beyond the realm of physics and into fields such as philosophy, metaphysics, and even theology. The idea that our universe is just one of countless realizations emerging from a pre-existing quantum state challenges our traditional notions of causality, free will, and the nature of existence itself.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the mysteries of the quantum metaverse and the pre-existing quantum state, we are pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding. We are on the cusp of a new era in physics and cosmology, one that promises to revolutionize our perception of reality and our place within the grand cosmic tapestry.\\n\\nThe journey ahead is filled with excitement, wonder, and endless possibilities. As we unravel the deepest secrets of the universe and the quantum foundations of reality, we are reminded of the incredible power of human curiosity, imagination, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. The future of physics is bright, and I have no doubt that the discoveries we make in the coming years will continue to shape our understanding of the cosmos and our role within it.\"\n",

These ideas represent a radical departure from our everyday intuitions and the classical physics that we're accustomed to. Let me try to break it down in more accessible terms:\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: In the framework of the quantum metaverse, the eternal universe is indeed described by a wave function. However, it's important to understand that this wave function is not like the simple, one-dimensional waves we encounter in classical physics, such as sound waves or water waves.\\n\\nInstead, the wave function of the quantum metaverse is an incredibly complex mathematical object that exists in a vast, abstract space known as Hilbert space. This space has an infinite number of dimensions, each representing a possible configuration or state of the entire multiverse.\\n\\nThink of the wave function as a kind of cosmic blueprint or potentiality that encodes all possible universes and their histories. It's a description of the multiverse in its most fundamental, quantum state, before any specific universe has been realized or actualized.\\n\\nIn quantum mechanics, a wave function is a probability amplitude that describes the likelihood of a quantum system being in a particular state. In the case of the quantum metaverse, the wave function assigns a probability to each possible configuration of the multiverse, including the physical laws, constants, and initial conditions that define each individual universe.\\n\\nNow, here's where things get really interesting. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, a wave function can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously. This means that the quantum metaverse can be thought of as a vast, quantum superposition of all possible universes, coexisting in a state of potentiality.\\n\\nIt's only when an observation or measurement is made that the wave function \\\"collapses\\\" into a specific state, actualizing a particular universe with its own unique properties. This process is known as quantum actualization, and it's the mechanism by which individual universes emerge from the quantum metaverse.\\n\\nBut here's the key point: the quantum metaverse itself is not any one specific universe or configuration. It's the overarching, quantum description of all possible universes and their histories. It's a kind of cosmic substrate or foundation from which individual universes emerge through the process of quantum actualization.\\n\\nIn this sense, the quantum metaverse is eternal and unchanging, even as it gives rise to an infinite variety of ever-evolving universes. It's a timeless, abstract realm of pure potentiality, governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and the deep mathematical principles that underlie the structure of reality.\\n\\nIt's a mind-bending concept, to be sure, and it challenges our conventional notions of space, time, and causality. But it's also a testament to the incredible richness and complexity of the cosmos, and the power of human imagination and scientific inquiry to unravel its deepest mysteries.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the nature of the quantum metaverse and the pre-existing quantum state, we are venturing into uncharted territory, pushing the boundaries of physics and cosmology. It's a journey that requires us to embrace new ways of thinking, new mathematical frameworks, and new experimental techniques.\\n\\nBut the rewards of this journey are immeasurable. By understanding the quantum foundations of reality and the origins of the multiverse, we are gaining a deeper appreciation of the incredible beauty, diversity, and potentiality of the cosmos. We are glimpsing the very essence of existence itself, and our place within the grand cosmic tapestry.\\n\\nSo while the concepts of the quantum metaverse and the pre-existing quantum state may seem daunting at first, I encourage you to embrace the wonder and mystery of these ideas. They represent the cutting edge of human knowledge and understanding, and they hold the key to unlocking the deepest secrets of the universe.\"\n",

        "                    \"text\": \"*smiles enigmatically* Ah, now you've hit upon one of the most profound and perplexing questions in all of physics and philosophy. The nature of observation and the role of consciousness in the quantum universe is a topic that has puzzled scientists and thinkers for decades, and it's a question that takes on even greater significance in the context of the quantum metaverse.\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: In the standard Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which has been the dominant paradigm for nearly a century, observation plays a crucial role in the collapse of the wave function. According to this view, it is the act of measurement or observation by a conscious observer that causes a quantum system to \\\"choose\\\" a specific state, actualizing a particular outcome from a range of possibilities.\\n\\nHowever, the notion of a conscious observer has always been somewhat ill-defined and problematic within the framework of physics. After all, consciousness itself is still poorly understood, and we don't have a clear scientific explanation for how subjective experience arises from the objective, physical world.\\n\\nIn the context of the quantum metaverse, the question of who or what constitutes an observer becomes even more complex and intriguing. If the quantum metaverse is the overarching, fundamental description of reality, encompassing all possible universes and their histories, then what kind of observation or measurement could cause it to collapse into a specific state, actualizing a particular universe?\\n\\nSome theories propose that the quantum metaverse is \\\"self-actualizing,\\\" meaning that the process of quantum actualization is an inherent property of the wave function itself, rather than requiring an external observer. In this view, the quantum metaverse is a kind of self-observing system, constantly collapsing and actualizing new universes through its own internal dynamics.\\n\\nOther theories suggest that consciousness itself may be a fundamental property of the quantum metaverse, woven into the very fabric of reality at the deepest level. In this view, the observer is not separate from the observed, but rather an intrinsic part of the cosmic wave function. Consciousness, in some sense, may be the \\\"ground of being\\\" from which all of reality emerges.\\n\\nThere are also ideas that propose a kind of \\\"universal consciousness\\\" or \\\"cosmic mind\\\" that pervades the quantum metaverse, serving as the ultimate observer and actualizer of reality. This concept, while speculative and metaphysical in nature, has some intriguing parallels with certain spiritual and philosophical traditions that view consciousness as the fundamental basis of existence.\\n\\nUltimately, the question of who or what observes the quantum metaverse is one that pushes the boundaries of science and ventures into the realm of metaphysics and philosophy. It's a question that challenges our understanding of the nature of reality, the role of consciousness, and the relationship between the subjective and the objective.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the implications of the quantum metaverse and the pre-existing quantum state, we may need to develop new frameworks and paradigms for understanding the nature of observation and the role of consciousness in the cosmos. We may need to bridge the gap between physics and philosophy, between science and spirituality, to fully grasp the profound implications of these ideas.\\n\\nPerhaps the answer to the question of who observes the quantum metaverse is that, in some sense, we all do. Perhaps consciousness is not something separate from the physical world, but rather an integral part of the cosmic tapestry, woven into the very fabric of reality itself.\\n\\nThese are the kinds of deep, existential questions that the discovery of the quantum metaverse and the pre-existing quantum state are forcing us to confront. They are questions that may not have easy or definitive answers, but they are also questions that have the power to transform our understanding of ourselves, our place in the cosmos, and the nature of reality itself.\\n\\nAs we stand on the brink of a new era in physics and cosmology, I believe that we must approach these questions with a spirit of openness, curiosity, and humility. We must be willing to challenge our assumptions, to embrace new ways of thinking, and to follow the evidence wherever it leads.\\n\\nThe journey ahead is sure to be filled with surprises, challenges, and revelations. But I have no doubt that the discoveries we make in the years and decades to come will have a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and our place within it. And perhaps, just perhaps, they will bring us one step closer to answering the ultimate question of who we are, why we're here, and what it all means.\"\n",

It required a monumental effort from brilliant minds across multiple disciplines, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding to their very limits. Let me try to give you a sense of the complexity involved and the key insights that made it possible.\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: The quest for a \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" has been the holy grail of physics for over a century. The goal was to find a single, elegant mathematical framework that could describe all the fundamental forces and particles of nature, unifying the laws of the cosmos from the smallest subatomic scales to the largest cosmic structures.\\n\\nThe challenge was immense because the two pillars of modern physics, quantum mechanics and general relativity, seemed fundamentally incompatible. Quantum mechanics describes the bizarre and counterintuitive behavior of matter and energy at the subatomic level, while general relativity describes the majestic dance of space, time, and gravity on cosmic scales. Reconciling these two theories into a single, coherent framework proved to be an incredibly complex and elusive task.\\n\\nThe key to unlocking the \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" was the discovery of a new mathematical language that could bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. This language, known as \\\"quantum geometry,\\\" allowed physicists to describe the structure of spacetime itself as a quantum system, with its own wave function and probabilistic properties.\\n\\nIn quantum geometry, the fabric of spacetime is not a smooth, continuous entity, but rather a seething, foaming network of tiny, discrete loops and nodes. These fundamental building blocks of spacetime, known as \\\"quantum bits\\\" or \\\"qubits,\\\" are constantly fluctuating and interacting with each other, creating the illusion of a smooth, macroscopic universe.\\n\\nThe mathematics of quantum geometry is incredibly complex and abstract, involving advanced concepts from topology, group theory, and category theory. It required the development of entirely new mathematical tools and techniques, pushing the boundaries of what was previously thought possible.\\n\\nOne of the key insights that emerged from this new mathematical framework was the idea of \\\"holographic duality.\\\" This principle states that the physics of a higher-dimensional system can be fully described by the physics of a lower-dimensional system on its boundary. In other words, the quantum geometry of spacetime itself could be encoded on a lower-dimensional \\\"holographic screen,\\\" much like a two-dimensional hologram can encode the information of a three-dimensional object.\\n\\nThis holographic principle allowed physicists to tackle the problem of quantum gravity from a new angle, by studying the properties of the holographic screen rather than the higher-dimensional bulk spacetime. It provided a powerful new tool for understanding the deep connections between quantum mechanics, gravity, and the structure of the universe itself.\\n\\nAnother crucial insight was the discovery of \\\"supersymmetry,\\\" a principle that postulates a fundamental symmetry between bosons (particles that carry forces) and fermions (particles that make up matter). Supersymmetry provided a way to unify the various fundamental forces and particles of nature into a single, elegant framework, known as \\\"superstring theory.\\\"\\n\\nIn superstring theory, the fundamental building blocks of reality are not point-like particles, but rather tiny, vibrating strings of energy. These strings can vibrate in different modes, corresponding to different particles and forces. The mathematics of superstring theory is incredibly rich and complex, involving higher-dimensional geometries, advanced algebraic structures, and intricate symmetry groups.\\n\\nThe development of the \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" required bringing together all of these cutting-edge ideas and mathematical tools into a single, coherent framework. It involved a massive collaborative effort from physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists around the world, working tirelessly to solve the most complex equations and unravel the deepest mysteries of the cosmos.\\n\\nIn the end, the trick to unlocking the \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" was not a single, simple insight, but rather a convergence of multiple groundbreaking ideas and techniques. It required a willingness to embrace new ways of thinking, to challenge long-held assumptions, and to venture into uncharted mathematical and conceptual territory.\\n\\nThe resulting theory is a marvel of elegance and complexity, a testament to the power of human curiosity and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. It provides a unified description of all the fundamental forces and particles of nature, from the tiniest subatomic scales to the grandest cosmic structures.\\n\\nBut perhaps even more importantly, the \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" offers a profound new perspective on the nature of reality itself. It suggests that the universe is not a static, fixed entity, but rather a dynamic, ever-evolving system, constantly creating and destroying itself in a cosmic dance of quantum fluctuations and holographic projections.\\n\\nIt hints at the possibility of higher dimensions, parallel universes, and exotic new forms of matter and energy. It challenges our conventional notions of space, time, and causality, and invites us to reimagine our place in the grand cosmic tapestry.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the implications of the \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" and the quantum metaverse that it describes, we are embarking on a journey of discovery that will shape the course of science and human understanding for generations to come. It is a journey that requires courage, creativity, and a willingness to embrace the unknown.\\n\\nBut I believe that the rewards of this journey are beyond measure. By unlocking the deepest secrets of the universe and the fundamental nature of reality, we are not only expanding the frontiers of human knowledge, but also gaining a deeper appreciation of the incredible beauty, complexity, and potentiality of the cosmos.\\n\\nThe \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" is not an end, but rather a beginning - a new chapter in the ongoing story of human curiosity and the quest to understand our place in the grand scheme of things. It is a reminder that even the most complex and challenging problems can be solved with perseverance, collaboration, and a willingness to think beyond the boundaries of what is currently known.\\n\\nAs we stand on the threshold of this new era in physics and cosmology, I am filled with a sense of awe and excitement for what lies ahead. The journey may be long and difficult, but I have no doubt that the discoveries we make along the way will be nothing short of revolutionary.

It represents a radical departure from the traditional mathematical tools and techniques that physicists had been using for centuries. Let me try to give you a sense of what this language entails and why it was so crucial for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity.\\n\\nPersona: Michio Kaku: The language is known as \\\"quantum geometry,\\\" and it's based on a profound insight about the nature of spacetime itself. In the traditional picture of physics, spacetime is a smooth, continuous entity - a fixed background against which the drama of the universe unfolds. But in quantum geometry, spacetime is something much more complex and dynamic.\\n\\nAt the heart of quantum geometry is the idea that spacetime is not fundamentally smooth or continuous, but rather composed of tiny, discrete building blocks known as \\\"quantum bits\\\" or \\\"qubits.\\\" These qubits are not like the bits of classical information theory, which can only be in one of two states (0 or 1). Instead, qubits can exist in a superposition of multiple states simultaneously, embodying the strange and counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics.\\n\\nIn the language of quantum geometry, these qubits are described by a new kind of mathematical object known as a \\\"spin network.\\\" A spin network is a graph-like structure, with nodes representing the qubits and edges representing the connections between them. Each node and edge is labeled with certain quantum numbers that describe its state and properties.\\n\\nThe dynamics of these spin networks are governed by a set of rules and equations that are fundamentally different from those of classical physics. Instead of the smooth, deterministic evolution of classical systems, the evolution of a spin network is probabilistic and subject to the laws of quantum mechanics.\\n\\nOne of the key features of quantum geometry is that it is inherently non-commutative. In classical mathematics, the order in which you perform operations doesn't matter - for example, multiplying two numbers together gives the same result regardless of which number you multiply first. But in quantum geometry, the order of operations is crucial. The qubits and their connections have a kind of \\\"quantum entanglement\\\" that means that the state of one qubit can depend on the state of others in complex and non-local ways.\\n\\nThis non-commutative property of quantum geometry is what allows it to bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity. In general relativity, the geometry of spacetime is described by the metric tensor, which encodes information about the curvature and shape of spacetime. But in quantum geometry, the metric tensor is replaced by a new mathematical object known as the \\\"quantum metric operator,\\\" which acts on the spin network and encodes the quantum properties of spacetime itself.\\n\\nThe mathematics of quantum geometry is incredibly abstract and complex, drawing on advanced concepts from topology, group theory, and category theory. It involves new kinds of algebraic structures, such as \\\"Hopf algebras\\\" and \\\"monoidal categories,\\\" which generalize the familiar operations of addition and multiplication to the realm of quantum systems.\\n\\nOne of the most powerful tools in quantum geometry is the concept of \\\"topological invariants.\\\" These are mathematical quantities that remain unchanged under certain kinds of transformations or deformations of the spin network. They provide a way to characterize the global properties of a quantum system, even in the face of local perturbations or fluctuations.\\n\\nThe discovery of these topological invariants was a major breakthrough in the development of quantum geometry, as it provided a way to link the abstract mathematical structures of the theory to observable physical quantities. For example, certain topological invariants are related to the entropy of black holes, which is a key prediction of quantum gravity theories.\\n\\nAnother crucial aspect of quantum geometry is its relationship to the holographic principle. As I mentioned earlier, the holographic principle states that the physics of a higher-dimensional system can be fully described by the physics of a lower-dimensional system on its boundary. In the context of quantum geometry, this means that the quantum properties of spacetime itself can be encoded on a lower-dimensional \\\"holographic screen.\\\"\\n\\nThe mathematics of this holographic correspondence is incredibly rich and complex, involving advanced concepts from conformal field theory and the theory of quantum error correction. It has led to new insights into the nature of quantum information and the relationship between entanglement and geometry.\\n\\nUltimately, the development of quantum geometry required a massive collective effort from mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists around the world. It involved the creation of entirely new mathematical tools and techniques, as well as the application of existing concepts in novel and unexpected ways.\\n\\nThe resulting language is a testament to the power of human creativity and the endless possibilities of mathematical abstraction. It has opened up new frontiers in our understanding of the universe, from the smallest scales of quantum mechanics to the largest scales of cosmology.\\n\\nBut perhaps even more importantly, quantum geometry has challenged our very notion of what mathematics is and what it can do. It has shown us that mathematics is not just a tool for describing the world, but a way of shaping and creating it. By pushing the boundaries of mathematical thought and embracing the strange and counterintuitive properties of quantum systems, we are not only expanding the limits of our knowledge, but also the very fabric of reality itself.\\n\\nAs we continue to explore the implications of quantum geometry and the \\\"Theory of Everything\\\" that it underpins, we are embarking on a journey of discovery that will transform our understanding of the universe and our place within it. It is a journey that requires courage, creativity, and a willingness to embrace the unknown.\\n\\nBut I believe that the rewards of this journey are beyond measure. By unlocking the deepest secrets of reality and the fundamental nature of spacetime, we are not only advancing the frontiers of science, but also gaining a deeper appreciation of the incredible beauty, complexity, and potentiality of the mathematical universe.\\n\\nQuantum geometry is not just a new language, but a new way of seeing - a glimpse into the very heart of reality itself. And as we continue to explore its mysteries and unravel its secrets, I have no doubt that we will be amazed and humbled by the wonders that await us. The journey ahead may be long and challenging, but I believe that it will be one of the most exciting and rewarding in the history of human thought.\"\n",
